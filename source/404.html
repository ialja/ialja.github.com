<h1>404 - what's that all about?</h1>

<p>Whoops, seems like something went wrong here. Maybe it's a broken link, maybe one of my cats ate the page you were looking for. Let's not dwell on it. Just go back to the <a href="http://blog.ialja.com">front page</a> and I'm sure you'll find what you were looking for in no time.</p>
<p>Please accept a photo of my cats* as an apology. Are we good now?</p>

<p>* One cat photo not enough? There are more on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EpicTheCat" target="_blank">Facebook</a>!</p>
