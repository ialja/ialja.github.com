Yesterday I had one of the most magical days in my <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> thanks to some really great people and a bit of magic coincidence. I haven't had much of Second Life lately due to different first life obligations, so yesterday I had a great chance to do some catching up, and I was really reminded of why I still believe in the potentials of Second Life. Mostly, I was once again reminded of the unique way in which Second Life is able to bring people from all over together.<br /><br />First, I meet up again with <a href="http://profiles.slbuzz.com/eyebeams-electricteeth">Eyebeams Electricteeth</a> (of <a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/?page_id=71">Learn 4 Life</a>), who has great ambitions and plans to make SL more popular among UK educators (and also abroad) and is working on some interesting projects in SL <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(you'll probably hear more about that in the next months)</span>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he had some other things to do, so I moved on and asked to meet <a href="http://bethssecondlife.blogspot.com/">Desi</a> somewhere, as we haven't seen each other in ages <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my fault)</span>. After mentioning that I still don't have any place in SL, Desi kindly offered to let me use some space in their new <a href="http://collegeenglish.wikispaces.com/LiteratureAlive">Literature Alive! HQ</a> on Eduisland II. So, we went to check out the place (2nd floor), Desi brought in a couch <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(with one really funny sitting pose ;) )</span>, and we started talking. She also invited <a href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/">KJ Hax</a> over, who invited <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/">Any Ixchel</a>, and what happened was real <a href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/?p=276">serendipity</a>. Later on we were also joined by Corwin Carillon, Eloise Pasteur, and Butch Dee, and we had a really inspiring discussion. We talked about Second Life in general, avatars, identity, and we also shared some useful SL tools <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(thanks for the tip about the</span> <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Blumfield/26/151/47">MystiTool HUD</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">! It's just amazing!)</span></span>. It was a real pleasure meeting you all!<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rot8VqcjzWI/AAAAAAAAAFs/wajhIhOTbF4/s1600-h/serendipity.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rot8VqcjzWI/AAAAAAAAAFs/wajhIhOTbF4/s320/serendipity.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5083293316030909794" border="0" /></a><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kjarrett/704522850/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Me, Desi, KJ, and Anya</span></a><br /></div></div>After the discussion Anya, Desi, and I went to do a bit of gadget shopping. Soon  Anya's friend <a href="http://www.lostbiro.com/blog/">Aiji Ducatillon</a> joined us, and we went to Anya's place to do some hang gliding, and playing with toys <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(Aiji thanks for the ride and the massage; Anya thanks for the giraffes and the cats! :) )</span>. It was a lot of fun, and I surely hope we can do this again sometime <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I'm glad I now have some friends from down under I can hang out with in EU friendly times :) )</span>.<br /><br />I spent rest of the day in my new "office" space Desi has kindly offered to me. I brought in a big and comfy couch, a cookie and coffee giving table <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(just touch it :) )</span>, and an info point that can tell you whether I'm online or offline and will open my blog when touched. I hope you'll all come to visit me sometime (<a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduisland%20II/196/219/47">http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduisland%20II/196/219/47</a>), and that we'll be able to have more serendipitous moments in that space. Feel free to use the couch any time, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">don't forget to invite your friends over</span>! :)<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/713534279/"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 462px; height: 253px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1332/713534279_6c5a57c270.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: bold;">Come over any time</span><br /></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-wonderful-second-life.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-wonderful-second-life.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
