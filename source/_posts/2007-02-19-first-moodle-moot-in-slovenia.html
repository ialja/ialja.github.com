At last! I am happy and proud to announce that the first Moodle Moot in Slovenia will be held on May 18th 2007 in Koper, Slovenia. Moodle Moots are conferences for <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> users that Moodle lovers organize all around the world (more info can be found <a href="http://moodlemoot.org/" target="_blank">here</a>). Since we opened <a href="http://www.moodle.si/" target="_blank">Moodle.si</a> (an online community for Moodle users in Slovenia) it's also been our wish to organize a live event where Moodle users can meet in person and exchange tips and tricks ;-) Now, after a few months of planning, meetings and ideas of all sorts we are finally a step closer to making our wish come true.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdnXh947-PI/AAAAAAAAADk/asoI6qs10zc/s1600-h/kartica.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; width: 278px; height: 149px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RdnXh947-PI/AAAAAAAAADk/asoI6qs10zc/s320/kartica.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5033291037112269042" /></a>More info about our <span style="font-weight: bold;">moodle.si </span>conference can be found <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=65" target="_blank">here</a>, although the site is in Slovenian language only. If you don't understand Slovenian and would like to know more about the conference  or even participate in some way, please feel free to leave a comment on this post or email me :-)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/first-moodle-moot-in-slovenia.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/first-moodle-moot-in-slovenia.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
