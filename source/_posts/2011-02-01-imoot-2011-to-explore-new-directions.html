<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2011.imoot.org/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TUfWkWg2FII/AAAAAAAAAq0/yxkBsc_JHYo/s1600/imoot+logo.png" /></a></div><p><a href="http://moodlemoot.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=11">MoodleMoots</a>, conferences dedicated to users, administrators and developers of Moodle, our beloved open-source learning management system, have always been my favorite events for exchanging learning and teaching experiences. This year, I'm particularly excited about attending <b><a href="http://2011.imoot.org/">iMoot2011</a></b>, the second annual web based International Moodle Moot.</p>iMoot2011 will be running from <b>30th April to 3rd May 2011</b>, 24 hours a day to accommodate different time zones. If you want to get involved as a presenter, you can <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=4">submit presentation proposals and academic papers</a>&nbsp;by February 19th, or&nbsp;<a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=9">register</a>&nbsp;as an attendee (got my early bird registration yesterday!).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=11" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="156" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TUfWyoZRhwI/AAAAAAAAAq4/aab6wPjlNIk/s320/new_directions.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />The theme for iMoot2011 is <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=11"><b>New Directions</b></a>, a fitting title considering Moodle 2.0 has finally been released at the end of last year. However, it's good to know that Moodle's new directions won't be the main focus on the conference; instead, the goal of the conference will be to explore the potential of using new technologies and pedagogical ideas in an evolving online learning space, where Moodle is just a piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />You can find more info about the conference on the <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/">official iMoot2011 website</a>. I'm certainly looking forward to participating in the conference, getting new ideas and meeting new and old Moolde buddies. Will you be joining us?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/02/imoot-2011-to-explore-new-directions.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/02/imoot-2011-to-explore-new-directions.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
