As you might have already noticed, my job description on LinkedIn, Facebook and on my blog has changed. Yes, it's true, after weeks of planning and considering different options I finally decided to try something new and co-found a company - <a href="http://www.artesia.si/">Artesia.si</a> that will specialize in 2D and 3D virtual communities. We will be offering consulting for companies wanting to improve or build virtual communities, and I will mostly focus on testing new technologies, planning and delivering (e)learning for our clients, and on presenting our company in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. At least for now we'll be focusing on the Slovenian market, so we only have a <a href="http://www.artesia.si/">website</a> in Slovenian. But we do have a <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Silicon%20City/208/159/28">virtual office</a> in Second Life that you can all visit <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(yeah, we're a real flat world company with no brick and mortar office :) )</span>. And things are actually already moving faster than we could hope for. On Thursday we were invited to help with a piece on Second Life for the <a href="http://24ur.com/naslovnica/novice/it/20070830_3104625.php">evening news on national television</a> in Slovenia! I have the video with English subtitles on <a href="http://profile.to/iAlja">Facebook</a> if you'd like to see how it turned out :)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtiAH3LGxQI/AAAAAAAAAGw/zofJPUe3wx8/s1600-h/artesia+office.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 456px; height: 353px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RtiAH3LGxQI/AAAAAAAAAGw/zofJPUe3wx8/s400/artesia+office.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5104971050182427906" border="0" /></a>But despite the fact that I'm changing jobs, I still intend to keep this blog alive. It will still remain my personal learning space, on which I'll be talking about my personal learning experiences, emerging technologies, and of course the occasional random thoughts of a geek :) So stay tuned, and if you've got more questions about my new professional adventure let me know!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/starting-up-new-adventure.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/starting-up-new-adventure.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
