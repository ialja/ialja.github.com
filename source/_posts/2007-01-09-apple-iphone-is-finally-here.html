Why the new Apple gadget (much more than just a mobile phone) is called iPhone still remains a mystery (didn't <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/18/cisco-not-apple-announces-iphone-branded-voip-phones/" target="_blank">Cisco</a> own that name?).<br /><br />Anyhow, the iPhone has a really revolutionary multi-touch screen that looks pretty simple and efficient (I can't wait to get my fingers on one!) and it runs Mac OS X so it's much much faster than current Symbian based "smartphones". That is why I really think it'll also be a great learning device (although the price will be quite high for some time). What else is there to say but: keep them coming Apple! Personally I can't wait for an improved iWork suite - hopefully with track changes and cross references ;)<br /><br />For more info on the iPhone check out the new site: <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">http://www.apple.com/iphone/</a><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/apple-iphone-is-finally-here.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/apple-iphone-is-finally-here.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
