Yes, it certainly has been a while since I last posted on this blog. I can easily think of several reasons for this: finding micro blogging easier for sharing quick ideas and cool content, having the feeling that what I have to say has already been written more eloquently somewhere else, not finishing drafts, spending more time writing a <a href="http://www.artesia.si/category/tags/spotlight">newsletter</a> for my company, dealing with health problems, struggling with finding the right direction and voice for this blog... and probably much more. But that's not really what I want to talk about today.<br /><br />I started this blog as a personal exploration of this new medium and perhaps it's best to keep it this way. It's just one of the many channels I use to communicate with the world and right now I have no desire to have this blog as my main channel. That's why I'm not writing this post to promise to blog more regularly or to keep this blog in a certain direction. And neither am I giving up on this blog completely. I might post again tomorrow, next month or even next year; the thing is that I just don't want to worry about that anymore. I never considered myself a blogger anyway; right now I'm just somebody who enjoys writing blog posts once in a while, and I think I do a better job at sharing interesting content through my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/11345071552136029281">Google Reader shared items </a>or on <a href="http://ialja.tumblr.com/">my recently revived tumblelog</a>.<br /><br />So, I guess I just wanted to make an announcement that this blog isn't quite dead yet, but at the same time admit that I really have no idea of what you can expect here. All I can do is to invite you to keep watching this space and watch its journey with me. Who knows, we might find something interesting along the way :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/02/in-case-youve-been-wondering.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/02/in-case-youve-been-wondering.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
