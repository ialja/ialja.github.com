It's been almost two years since I created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o1fMQsfzoQ">brief video presentation</a> of <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>, and now I finally took the time to update it with a new version. Initially, I just wanted to update the usage statistics, but I ended up doing a redesign, and I also added some information, so it's slightly longer than the previous version. In addition to that, the video is now available in better quality and in widescreen format. And now, without further ado, I present you the new, improved Moodle Presentation:<br /><br /><div align="center"><object height="295" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WvCIv5KCbeE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01&amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D22"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WvCIv5KCbeE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0xe1600f&amp;color2=0xfebd01&amp;ap=%2526fmt%3D22" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="295" width="480"></embed></object></div><br />You can view the video presentation on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvCIv5KCbeE&amp;fmt=22">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/3867499">Vimeo</a>, and <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1922295">blip.tv</a>. I created the presentation in <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Apple's Keynote</a>, so you can also view the slides that I used on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/moodle-presentation-version-20-1203736">SlideShare</a>.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this presentation; and feel free to use it to spread the word about Moodle!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-moodle-presentation.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-moodle-presentation.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
