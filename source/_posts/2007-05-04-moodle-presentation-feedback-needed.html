The past few weeks have really been busy for me, so I don't get nearly as much time to blog as I'd like to :( But today I'm really excited about the fact that I can finally share a Moodle presentation that I've been working on for some time. The presentation will be used at the <a href="/2007/02/first-moodle-moot-in-slovenia.html">first Moodle Moot in Slovenia</a> that my faculty is organizing on May 18th. The plan is to have the video play during the conference (at the beginning or/and during coffee breaks), and also include a copy on the conference CD that our attendees will get after the conference.<br /><br />So, if you have 2 minutes to spare, please take a look at my Moodle  Presentation draft:<br /><div align="center"><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_o1fMQsfzoQ"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_o1fMQsfzoQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></div><br />I'd really like to get some feedback on this video, so don't hesitate to leave your comments or suggestions  here on my blog or on YouTube :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">(Small print: this presentation is actually a translation of the original presentation that I made </span><a style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTPSUxiXdFU">in Slovenian</a><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">, so I apologize in advance for any awkward translations :") )</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/moodle-presentation-feedback-needed.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/moodle-presentation-feedback-needed.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
