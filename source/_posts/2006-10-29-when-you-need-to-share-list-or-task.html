I’ve always wanted a simple and efficient way to share lists and notes online with other people and the option to access shared items anywhere (even on my mobile). And so it was that I finally found <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/" target="_blank">Backpack</a>. Backpack is a great service for keeping list online and share them with other people. You can sign up at Backpack for free, though a free account has a few limitations (limited number of pages and no image sharing). Still, I found that the free account works just fine for me. I use it to keep a list of grocery shopping and a list of movies I want to see in the future - both list are shared with interested parties ;)<br /><br />Also, I recently found an interesting service <a href="http://monkeyon.com/" target="_blank">Monkey on Your Back</a> that lets you send email “monkeys” that remind other people of their tasks. Unfortunately, other users can also send you reminder monkey, so watch out for monkeys on your back! ;) (A free account only lets you have 5 active monkeys at a time.)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/when-you-need-to-share-list-or-task.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/when-you-need-to-share-list-or-task.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
