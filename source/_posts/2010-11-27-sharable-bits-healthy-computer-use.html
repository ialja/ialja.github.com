And as someone with several vision problems, I pay extra attention to what we can do to protect our vision. The <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/25/eye-health/">blog post</a> provides great starting tips, especially the one about taking regular breaks and remembering to blink (sounds obvious, but it isn't when you are engaged in an epic game battle or get caught in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>). A tool I often like to use is <a href="http://www.dejal.com/timeout/">Time Out</a>, a simple break reminder app for Mac OS X.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Blog post: Technology in Education</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b>&nbsp;</b><a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/22/technology-in-education/"><b>8 Ways Technology Is Improving Education</b></a><br /><br /></div><b>Why it's worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;A great showcase of technology use in education that work and are simple to understand. Always handy to have such lists ready when talking to technology skeptics, who think of anything digital as pure evil. Especially with the media habit of presenting the digital risks before the benefits. The recent NYTimes article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/technology/21brain.html">Growing Up Digital, Wired for Distraction</a>&nbsp;does explore both sides, but the headline is still all about distraction. Isn't it time to challenge that perception?<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Video: Fiddle Quartet on the iPad</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/U8wjFmLQJT4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/U8wjFmLQJT4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br /><b>Why it's worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;Seeing phones and tablets turned into music instruments with the help of magical mobile apps never stops to amaze me. And I can't wait to get an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> just to try <a href="http://smule.com/magicfiddle">Magic Fiddle</a>, the latest app from <a href="http://smule.com/">Smule</a> (developers of Ocarina), which turns your iPad into a fiddle. Isn't it great to have a single, affordable device that works as dozens of instruments? I sure do hope it brings the joys of playing musical instruments into the hands of more people.<br /><br />Related posts:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2010-11-10-Smule10_ST_N.htm">Smule adds Magic Fiddle to its Ocarina and Magic Piano apps</a> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">(the story behind Smule's success)</span></li><li><a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/25/iphone-ipad-music/#ADEHmkL3HBg">10 Terrific iPhone and iPad Musical Performances</a> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">(more iPad/iPhone music magic)</span></li></ul><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><b>Sharable Bits</b> is a series of weekly posts that will highlight some of the most interesting bits and bytes that I stumble upon.
