One of the most interesting blog posts I’ve come across in the past days was certainly a post on the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/" target="”_blank”">Official Google Blog</a> with the title <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html" target="”_blank”">Do you “Google”?</a>. In the post the author argues about the usage of the the trademark “Google” in everyday language. Though most of the bloggers that link to this post seem upset about it, I think it’s a great post that shows the playful and clever spirit of everything that Google does.<br /><br />Anyhow, not wanting to piss more people off, I’d like to write I few lines about why do I personally Google in many way with a variety of Google products. Well, first of all, I must make a confession - at the end of the 90-ies and at the start of the new millennium I was a great Yahoo!, but then a couple of years ago I finally made my switch to Google because of the simplicity and usefulness of their services. And the switch has been almost as good as the switch from Windows PCs to a Mac ;)<br /><br />One of the things that made me in love with Google was certainly <a href="http://gmail.google.com/" target="”_blank”">Gmail</a>. It meant goodbye to 2 MB inbox limits and hello 1 GB mail limit! Plus simplicity, mail labels, and the ability to check my mail in any way I like (mobile phone, resident mail application). And also, now I don’t have to worry about what will happen to my mails if my mail program or computer malfunction. Like most of us, I am also pretty lazy when it comes to backups. Yes, I know, we should make regular backups blah blah - but to tell the truth, you always remember about making backups just a few seconds after something terrible happens with your data. Now, with Gmail I just don’t have that worry anymore. I also use my mail account to send myself working copies of important documents, and all my important mails are on the Web, so should my computer crash I can all get it back quite painlessly.<br /><br />And then, now we also have <a href="http://docs.google.com/" target="”_blank”">Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets</a> that enables online editing, creating and sharing of text documents and spreadsheets. I still have to give this new service a try, but Google again seems one step ahead of me once more :)<br /><br />Moving on, we still have other great products and services from Google. <a href="http://earth.google.com/" target="”_blank”">Google Earth</a> is already a classic app, and recently I discovered <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/" target="”_blank”">Google SketchUp</a>, with which I was able to make plans for a room renovation!?! Really Google, what’s next?<br /><br />Not to be too long, I’d finally like to add the link to a quite recent site <a href="http://www.google.com/educators/index.html" target="”_blank”">Google for Educators</a> that lists all the great Google stuff that can be used for education purposes. All I can say to that is: keep ‘em coming Google! :)<br /><br />(Btw: Google also thinks of Mac users - check out the <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/" target="”_blank”">Official Google Mac Blog</a>.)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-do-i-google.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-do-i-google.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
