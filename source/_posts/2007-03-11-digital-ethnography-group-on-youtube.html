Remember the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gmP4nk0EOE">Web 2.0 ... The Machine is Us/ing Us</a> video that presented the Web 2.0 concept under 5 minutes (I also posted it <a href="/2007/02/web-20-in-less-than-5-minutes_05.html">on my blog</a>)? It got a lot of (deserved) attention in the edu blogosphere and recently the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLlGopyXT_g">final version of the video</a> was posted on YouTube. As it seems, we can expect more great videos like this from the <a href="http://mediatedcultures.net/ksudigg/">Digital Ethnography group</a>, guided by <a href="http://www.ksu.edu/sasw/anthro/wesch.htm">Michael Wesch</a> at the Kansas State University. They've just released a new video: <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">ntroducing our YouTube Ethnography Project</span>, in which the students and their professor present themselves and invite all of us to interact with them through YouTube. Take a look:<br /><div align="center"><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tYcS_VpoWJk"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tYcS_VpoWJk" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></div>A visit to <a href="http://mediatedcultures.net/ksudigg/">their blog</a> is also suggested.<br /><br />I think their project is a really interesting one -  not just for the fields of ethnography and anthropology. For educators that are exploring possible uses of technology in education this project is a great example of what a powerful tool Web 2.0 has become. These students are now able to interact with a global audience and get valuable feedback on their work from all around the world in different media formats. Wow! All I can say is - thumbs up for the Digital Ethnography group! I hope to see (and also participate in) more projects like this in the future.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/03/digital-ethnography-group-on-youtube.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/03/digital-ethnography-group-on-youtube.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
