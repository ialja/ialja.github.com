With great joy and pride I can finally announce the public opening of my company's first major Second Life project: the MMC island. MMC island is an extension of Multimedia center, the new media department of Slovenian public broadcaster (<a href="http://www.rtvslo.si/">RTV Slovenija</a>). The main purpose of the island is to provide users with the ability to organize their own events on group owned and managed land. You can read more about the project in <a href="http://www.artesia.si/english/?p=159">our press release</a>.<br /><br />You can already visit the island right now, and on <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Saturday, March 29th from 10 AM to 4 PM SLT</span> we'll be having the official opening party with 6 hours of live music and other activities (including a presentation of the project in English at 1 PM SLT). Here is the promo video we made at the rehearsal party (the real one will be even better! ;) ):<div><br /></div><div align="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fialja%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss&amp;file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F775884&amp;showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf" allowfullscreen="true" id="showplayer" height="255" width="400"><param name="movie" value="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fialja%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss&amp;file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F775884&amp;showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf"><param name="quality" value="best"><embed src="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&amp;feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fialja%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss&amp;file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F775884&amp;showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf" quality="best" name="showplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="255" width="400"></embed></object><br /></div><div>So, I hope you can all come to visit <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/MMC/93/128/26">our new sim</a>, and admire the amazing builds made by <a href="http://betatechnologies.info/">Beta Technologies</a>.
