Skitch offers different ways for getting images: you can take snapshots <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(it's easy to capture just part of your screen)</span>, take a photo through your camera or work on any photo on your hard drive or on the web by dragging it into Skitch. Once you've got a photo in, you can add text and various shapes, and do a few basic edits. When you're done, you can easily share it in any way you want. And what if you want to change the text or delete a shape later? No problem, you can always come back to the saved or uploaded images later and edit them again through Skitch <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(by the way - Skitch can also export images in the </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">svg</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> format; apart from the standard jpg, png, pdf and tif of course)</span>.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://myskitch.com/ialja/skitch_test-20071003-113531/"><img style="width: 312px; height: 236px;" src="http://myskitch.com/ialja/skitch_test-20071003-113531.png/preview.jpg" alt="Skitch test" /></a><br /><a style="font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: 10px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);" href="http://plasq.com/skitch">Uploaded with Skitch!</a></div>I saw the promo video of Skitch some time ago, but then I really didn't imagine how great it is to actually use it. It's super fast, very easy to use <span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">(I love the fact that you get subtle, not intrusive, and useful help tips just when you need them)</span>, and it works like magic <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(even though it's still a beta)</span>. The app was created by <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>, the makers of <a href="http://plasq.com/comiclife">Comic Life</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(another application I love to use!)</span>, and I can only hope that we all get a copy of Skitch in the next releases of Mac OS X <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(just like we get the basic version of Comic Life)</span>.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://myskitch.com/ialja/skitch_helptips-20071003-115353/"><img style="width: 388px; height: 196px;" src="http://myskitch.com/ialja/skitch_helptips-20071003-115353.png/preview.jpg" alt="skitch helptips" /></a><br /><a style="font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: 10px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);" href="http://plasq.com/skitch">Uploaded with Skitch!</a></div>I really see myself using this application a lot for different purposes. One obvious use is surely  making images for blogs, and I think it will also be great for making annotated screenshots for user manuals <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(which can be really time consuming!)</span>, sharing ideas fast or just having fun by adding captures to photos :) Skitch is surely a great product that wisely uses simplicity and provides with all the tools you need to make photo sharing a bit more fun and fast. I think I'll keep the Skitch icon <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(it's a cute pink heart :) )</span> in my dock from now on, just in case I need to skitch something fast <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(it's surely much faster than Photoshop for simple tasks Skitch was built for)</span>. <strike>The only negative comment I can make about Skitch so far, is the fact that I didn't get a 100 invites, so unfortunately I can't yet invite you all to try it :(</strike><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br /><br />If you want to know more about Skitch, take a look at plasq's site and <a href="http://plasq.com/skitch#demo">watch the Skitch introductory video</a>, which is in my opinion a great example of how to make an attractive video manual for first time users <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I usually give up on video manuals after a few seconds, but this one kept me interested)</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Edit:</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> Just got 100 invites to give out! Leave you e-mail under the comments or e-mail me at ialja (at) mac (dot) com to get an invite and to try out the Skitch magic :)</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/skitch-fast-n-easy-photo-sharing-review.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/skitch-fast-n-easy-photo-sharing-review.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
