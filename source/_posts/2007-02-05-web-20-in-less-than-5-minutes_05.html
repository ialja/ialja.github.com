Yesterday I came across an amazing video presentation of the concept of Web 2.0 created by   <a href="http://www.ksu.edu/sasw/anthro/wesch.htm" target="_blank">Michael Wesch</a>. It's a short and concise presentation of some important concepts and ideas about Web 2.0 (or the Read/Write Web). I think this video can be a great starting point for a discussion or reflection on how modern technologies are affecting many important areas of our lives and why is Internet such a big thing nowadays. Enjoy watching it!</p><div align="center"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6gmP4nk0EOE"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6gmP4nk0EOE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/web-20-in-less-than-5-minutes_05.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/web-20-in-less-than-5-minutes_05.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
