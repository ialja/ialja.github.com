Today I decided to give the new version of Blogger a try, and some of the new features are really great. Finally, we have post labels, and the new way of editing blog templates is really cool and easy! I had to change my blog template a bit, but I'm pretty satisfied with the new look :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/blogger-beta.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/blogger-beta.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
