Today is a good day! We finally managed to open all content of the site <a href="http://www.moodle.si/" target="_blank">Moodle.si</a> to the public! Moodle.si is an attempt to establish an online community of <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> users in Slovenia, so anybody from Slovenia that is reading this post and is a Moodle user is invited to join the community ;) (By the way - the site is exclusively in Slovenian language, so if you're looking for a Moodle community in English I suggest the official <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle site</a>.)<br /><br />And what can be found on the site? So far we created a database activity where users can add info about their <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/data/view.php?id=1" target="_blank">Moodle sites</a> and a database activity where users can post their <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/data/view.php?id=2" target="_blank">favorite teaching/learning links</a>. We also opened a <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/forum/view.php?id=4" target="_blank">general discussion forum</a> and prepared a course for teacher/tutor discussions that is available to registered users. In this course we created Wiki-based instructions for teachers on how to use Moodle (version 1.6.2) that users can freely edit, and opened forums that focus on teaching with Moodle. (If you don't speak Slovenian and would like to know more about our content, feel free to contact me.)<br /><br />Today we also sent out invitations to Moodle users that are <a href="http://moodle.org/sites/index.php?country=SI" target="_blank">listed on the Moodle site</a> and now we are anxious to receive feedback from the first users that will be joining the community. I really hope people will like and accept this idea and that the site will become a place where we'll share ideas, experiences, and construct new knowledge :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/moodlesi-at-last.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/moodlesi-at-last.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
