<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html" target="_blank">Web 2.0</a> has become a popular buzz word and of course you can't have Web 2.0 with ordinary e-learning - so now it's time for E-learning 2.0! Confused? Yeah, I know how you feel. But I think that reading <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=29-1" target="_blank">this article</a> about E-learning 2.0 by <a href="http://www.downes.ca/" target="_blank">Stephen Downes</a> can help you to understand the meaning and practical application of these buzz words.<br /><br />For me E-learning 2.0 represents a real opportunity to finally shift the focus from the technology to the users and to make e-learning really a <span style="font-weight: bold;">learning</span> experience and not just a different form of study material delivery. Education does in my opinion need to move with the technology developments. Not only because we need to develop <a href="http://www.ncrel.org/engauge/skills/engauge21st.pdf" target="_blank">appropriate 21st century skills </a>to keep with up new technologies, but also because we need to learn how to involve <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf" target="_blank">digital native</a> generations in learning.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-is-e-learning-20.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-is-e-learning-20.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
