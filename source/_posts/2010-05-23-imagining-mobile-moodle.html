For this year's <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/course/view.php?id=15">4th International Slovenian MoodleMoot</a> I decided to explore the efforts being made to bring Moodle to mobile devices. I found several interesting projects in this field, although I think we're just starting to explore all possibilities, and that more interesting developments will follow in the next few years, especially when teachers start experimenting with things like geolocation, augmented reality and resources that can interact with sensors on mobile devices.<br /><br />The main goal of my paper and presentation was to invite teachers to think about possibilities that mobile devices can offer for education and the ways we could embed mobile learning in Moodle, a well established Learning Management System.<br /><br />Here's the abstract from my paper <b>Taking Moodle Out of the Classroom: Making Learning Mobile, Context-Aware and Fun</b>:<br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #0b5394;">"Mobile devices are becoming increasingly more powerful, better connected and are able to provide better user experience and new services based around location and context of users, which opens new possibilities for learning. The paper presents an overview of mobile learning and the efforts being made to provide better support for mobile devices and learning activities/resources in Moodle. In conclusion we also present some future trends in mobile computing that could also provide new ways of learning on the go."</span></i><br /><br />You can see a video of my presentation at the conference on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEU-6w3VhOU">YouTube</a> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">(total length 15 min)</span>:<br /><br /><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YEU-6w3VhOU&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YEU-6w3VhOU&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br />And if you'd like to learn more about the topic, you can read my full paper on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/31765265/Taking-Moodle-Out-of-the-Classroom-Making-Learning-Mobile-Context-Aware-and-Fun">Scribd</a>:<br /><br /><object data="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf" height="600" id="doc_734036138548940" name="doc_734036138548940" style="outline: none;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560">  <param name="movie" value="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><param name="FlashVars" value="document_id=31765265&access_key=key-1jqleqk19b0srysfs3bo&page=1&viewMode=list"><embed id="doc_734036138548940" name="doc_734036138548940" src="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf?document_id=31765265&access_key=key-1jqleqk19b0srysfs3bo&page=1&viewMode=list" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="600" width="560" wmode="opaque" bgcolor="#ffffff"></embed>  </object><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/05/imagining-mobile-moodle.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/05/imagining-mobile-moodle.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
