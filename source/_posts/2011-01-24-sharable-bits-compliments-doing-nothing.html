<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Blog post: Genuine compliments matter</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://coolcatteacher.blogspot.com/2011/01/students-say-id-rather-have-compliment.html"><b>Students say: "I'd rather have a compliment than sex or pizza!"</b></a></div><br /><b>Why it's worth sharing:</b> Vicki A. Davis reminds us about how important it is to give genuine compliments to our students and colleagues every day. I certainly try to follow this advice in my day to day work. Remembering to thank people for their effort and acknowledging their success is a simple gesture that can make a big impact. After all, we all want to be good at what we're doing and to know that what we do is meaningful, don't we?<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Challenge: Do Nothing for Two Minutes</span></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TT2CuUTc9JI/AAAAAAAAAqs/XKTRdWJDWRI/s1600/do-nothing-for-2-minutes.png" /></a></div><br /><b>Why it's worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;It's a <a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/">simple website</a> with a simple idea: relax and do nothing for only two minutes. Easy, no? Well, it turns out it can be quite a challenge if you're used to constantly check your e-mails, Facebook, Twitter and what not. It's certainly a nice idea that encourages to stop and relax, even if it is just for our couple of minutes. Perhaps we'd all felt a little bit better if we passed this simple challenge every day.

As someone, who tends to sit behind the computer desk in awkward positions all day long, I find this idea quite intriguing. I admit - I haven't decided to make the switch yet, but at least the post reminded me that I should get up and stretch more often during the day.<br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><b>Sharable Bits</b> is a series of weekly posts that will highlight some of the most interesting bits and bytes that I stumble upon.
