I've been completely busy in the past few days, but today I've really got to share something with you. You know I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, but today I came across (via <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2007/05/30/microsoft-launches-multitouch-surface-computing/">Mac Rumors</a>) a video presentation of a brand new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> product - Microsoft Surface - that just took my breath away. It's a multi-user multi-touch 30in-ch display on which your fingers do the magic. No mouse, just playing around with your hands or other objects. I suggest checking out  the <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4217348.html">first look article with video</a> at Popularmechanics.com, which explains the capabilities of this new product in more detail, and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">official Microsoft Surface site</a>.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rl0cRgOtFVI/AAAAAAAAAFU/r-ijxeH1-j4/s1600-h/MS-surface.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 218px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rl0cRgOtFVI/AAAAAAAAAFU/r-ijxeH1-j4/s320/MS-surface.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5070239842524009810" border="0" /></a>Finally, the technology we've been waiting for years is a step closer to the consumers! Of course, it will be a quite expensive, but it's a step in the right direction. I know I will have to wait to get my hand on one of these surface computers for quite a while, but I can already see many great things one could use such a computer for, can't you? :) This time it's definitely thumbs up for Microsoft!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/surface-computing-has-arrived.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/surface-computing-has-arrived.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
