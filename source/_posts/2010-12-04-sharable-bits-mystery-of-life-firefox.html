<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Discovery: Life built with toxic chemicals</span></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/astrobiology_toxic_chemical.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TPoOXUvCqFI/AAAAAAAAAnc/dtFLNfBiP6o/s320/NASA-Mono_Lake.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i>Mono Lake Research area (source: <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/astrobiology_toxic_chemical.html">NASA</a>)</i></div><br /><b>Why it's worth sharing:</b> When NASA announced a press conference about a new discovery related to astrobiology, many were hoping for a confirmation of extraterrestrial life. The actual news wasn't as huge as expected - they found a bacteria living on arsenic right on our home planet - but it's still significant because it shows how little we actually know about life and how much we tend to assume. I certainly hope the discovery encourages us to keep looking further into space and deeper into our own planet.<br /><br />More about the discovery:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2034601,00.html">Arsenic and Old Space: A Key to Life on Other Planets? - TIME</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/astrobiology_toxic_chemical.html">NASA-Funded Research Discovers Life Built With Toxic Chemical - NASA</a></li></ul><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">News: Mozilla project protects the open web and endangered species with cuteness</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tBhfU0Cr6X0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tBhfU0Cr6X0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br /><b>Why it's worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;Helping the open web and the insanely adorable red pandas all at once - what's not to like? :) Great <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2010/12/03/meet-the-newest-and-cutest-mozillians/">initiative by the Mozilla Project</a> that uses cuteness to remind us about the importance of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/biodiversity">preserving biodiversity</a> on our planet.

Sure, it's a nice view from the window when you don't have to go out, but snow quickly turns into an issue if you're planning on running outdoors throughout the winter. Luckily I found the perfect solution: <a href="http://www.yaktrax.com/pro">YakTrax Pro</a> ice grips that&nbsp;help prevent slipping on packed snow and&nbsp;can be worn on any regular shoe. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.yaktrax.co.uk/yaktrax-shop/yaktrax-walker-pro/yaktrax-pro" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TPoYSClhVhI/AAAAAAAAAng/7-tB02yoexA/s1600/yaktrax-pro.jpg" /></a></div><br /><b>Why it's worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;The most simple ideas can sometimes make a big difference. Not as big of a news as the NASA discovery or endangered species preservation, but nonetheless a great tool that will help me stay fit and healthy during the dark, cold winter. Staying in and being cosy is so tempting that I welcome anything that makes going out a bit easier. I'm actually looking forward to all the snow runs now!<br /><br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><b>Sharable Bits</b> is a series of weekly posts that will highlight some of the most interesting bits and bytes that I stumble upon.
