We often get caught in thinking about the right and wrong ways of using tools like presentations, blogs, Twitter, and what not. Sure, it helps to know what mistakes to avoid -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/thecroaker/death-by-powerpoint">death by PowerPoint</a>&nbsp;anyone? - but that doesn't mean you have to limit yourself to the <i>"10 rules of [insert sticky title]<insert catchy="" here="" title="">"</insert></i>.<br /><br />A great example: meet <a href="http://travisisaacs.com/">Travis Isaacs</a>, user experience designer. He uses <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a>, a presentation software, to create wireframe prototypes for websites. Wait, what?<br /><br />That's certainly not in any rulebook or manual, but it sure works. And Travis even figured out how to turn his approach into a product (more about that on <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/12/travis-isaacs-web-design/">Mashable:&nbsp;Essential Web Design Advice From a Wireframing Master</a>).<br /><div id="__ss_4347737" style="width: 560px;"><strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 12px; text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><object height="468" id="__sse4347737" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=keynote-kung-fu-100528224132-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=keynote-kungfu-how-to-wireframe-like-a-ninja&userName=tbisaacs" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse4347737" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=keynote-kung-fu-100528224132-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=keynote-kungfu-how-to-wireframe-like-a-ninja&userName=tbisaacs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="468"></embed></object></span></strong></div><br />Somehow that reminds me of a quote from the movie&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/quotes">Pirates of The Caribbean</a>:<br /><blockquote><i><b>Elizabeth</b>: You have to take me to shore! According to the Code of the Order of the Brethrenâ€”</i></blockquote><blockquote><i><b>Barbossa</b>: First, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, so I 'must' do nothing. And secondly, you must be a pirate for the Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not. And thirdly, the code is more what you call "guidelines" than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner!</i></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TOlKX3EbCBI/AAAAAAAAAm8/q11e338Tzjs/s1600/captain-barbossa-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="199" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TOlKX3EbCBI/AAAAAAAAAm8/q11e338Tzjs/s320/captain-barbossa-1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>So, the next time you discover a fancy list of rules for using this and that, think about whether the rules apply to you (are you a pirate or are you a ninja?) and whether it would be helpful to improvise and invent new rules.&nbsp;Think of the usual ways of using a tool as guidelines, not rules. Sometimes a little hack goes a long way!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/11/dont-be-afraid-to-break-rules.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/11/dont-be-afraid-to-break-rules.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
