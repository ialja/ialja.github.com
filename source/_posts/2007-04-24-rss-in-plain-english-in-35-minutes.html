I just wanted to share with you a great video that explains what RSS feeds are in plain English in 3.5 minutes:<br /><br /><center>               <script type="text/javascript" src="http://blip.tv/scripts/pokkariPlayer.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://blip.tv/syndication/write_player?skin=js&posts_id=209879&amp;source=3&autoplay=true&amp;amp;file_type=flv&player_width=&amp;player_height="></script><div id="blip_movie_content_209879"><a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Leelefever-RSSInPlainEnglish369.flv" onclick="play_blip_movie_209879(); return false;"><img src="http://blip.tv/file/get/Leelefever-RSSInPlainEnglish369.flv.jpg" title="Click To Play" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Leelefever-RSSInPlainEnglish369.flv" onclick="play_blip_movie_209879(); return false;">Click To Play</a></div>          </center><br />Just what I've been looking for an introduction to RSS! I'm just amazed that so many people are still unaware of this great technology. But of course that also means that are still many people out there that we can show the magic of RSS to ;) RSS feeds really help me to get all the interesting news; although I admit that I sometimes do feel overwhelmed by so many new items calling for attention and deserving to be read on my own computer :)<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(By the way: for more info on the video check </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.commoncraft.com/rss_plain_english">this Common Craft post</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/04/rss-in-plain-english-in-35-minutes.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/04/rss-in-plain-english-in-35-minutes.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
