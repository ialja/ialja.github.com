Before filling my blog with any serious posts, I'd also like to explain the motives that made me start this blog. <br /><br />Firstly, out of gratitude towards many of the blogs I’ve been visiting lately (check my links to blogs), and that have shown me the value of sharing great ideas that can help to improve the overall quality of e-learning (both for me personally and the students at our faculty). And for this reason I felt that I can offer my share of ideas that will hopefully inspire somebody out there and make learning more fun and efficient.<br /><br />Secondly, I realized that the number of my bookmarks and saved articles on the broad subject of e-learning is rapidly increasing and that I need a way to keep track of all the interesting things I stumble upon during my research work. And so I got the idea that I could use a blog to keep some sort of list of interesting subjects, sites, ideas, and thoughts that I encounter on a daily basis. And, as already mentioned, I can also hope that my journal of thought stimulating posts can help others that are (like me) surfing the cyberspace for new ideas.<br /><br />And so it was (lo and behold!) that with a few clicks my blog was born. And to keep true to the purpose of the blog, here’s an <a href=” http://ella.slis.indiana.edu/~sstoerge/edublog.htm” target="_blank">article about blogging in education</a> I found today and that provides links to a few interesting articles on the subject (and yes, a few of them already made it to my “interesting articles” folder :) ).<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-blog.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/why-blog.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
