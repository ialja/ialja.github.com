Through a very interesting post <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2007/02/creative_video_.html" target="_blank">Creative video presentations</a> at the <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/" target="_blank">Presentation Zen</a> blog I found the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/htmljokes/pool/" target="_blank">Visual HTML Jokes</a> pool of photos that illustrate different HTML tags in a creative and fun way. My favorite photo of the pool is definitely this one:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/136/346483297_c4cb93ab4e_m.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 169px; height: 240px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/136/346483297_c4cb93ab4e_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(Created by by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jesper/" target="_blank">Jesper RÃ¸nn-Jensen</a>)</span><br /></div>I think these photos can be really useful when teaching the concept of HTML tags. Also, I think challenging students to create their own illustrated HTML tags would be a really great and fun learning activity, in which both sides of the brain are engaged.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/illustrated-html-tags.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/illustrated-html-tags.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
