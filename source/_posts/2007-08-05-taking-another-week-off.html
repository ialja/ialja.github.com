This time I'm going to sunny Greece, and I won't be taking my laptop or have internet access, so it'll be a real <span style="font-style: italic;">offline holiday</span>. I'll be back on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Monday</span>, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">13th</span>, and until then I won't be answering my mails or other messages <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(Facebook, Second Life etc)</span>. But I'm planning on having a little experiment with <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">Twitter</a> on my cell phone. I'll post some updates from my phone during the next week <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I'm just telling my mom how she can receive notifications :) )</span>, and I've also turned on mobile notifications for some of my favorite contacts. I'm really curious about how this will work out :)<br /><br />So, I'll be posting again after I return, and hopefully I'll have some nice photos to upload to Flickr :) <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I'm such a Web 2.0 addict!)</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/taking-another-week-off.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/taking-another-week-off.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
