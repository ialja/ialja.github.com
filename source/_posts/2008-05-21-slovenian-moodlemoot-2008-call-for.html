Today I have the pleasure to invite you all to attend or present at the upcoming <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/course/view.php?id=10">Slovenian MoodleMoot</a>. Some of you may remember me writing about <a href="/2007/05/report-first-slovenian-moodle-moot.html">last year's</a> (first) Slovenian Moodle conference, but the big change this year is that we're making the conference more international and more accessible to a wider audience. We will be in fact broadcasting the international section of the conference live in <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> and we're also looking for international presenters that are willing to present their experience with <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> or <a href="http://sloodle.org/">Sloodle</a> to the Slovenian and Second Life audience through Second Life. The combination of physical and virtual presentations will be the first of its kind for everyone involved, so I hope we can get the technology to cooperate ;)<br /><br />And here's more info about the conference and about how international guests and presenters can get involved:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SDQdo7RRGNI/AAAAAAAAAO0/i0Kw8GR5ER0/s1600-h/MoodleMoot+SLO+2008.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 174px; height: 113px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SDQdo7RRGNI/AAAAAAAAAO0/i0Kw8GR5ER0/s320/MoodleMoot+SLO+2008.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5202816058461853906" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><b>When: June 6th, 2008<br />Where: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koper" title="Koper" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" class="zem_slink">Koper</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia" title="Slovenia" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" class="zem_slink">Slovenia</a>; Second Life®<br />Deadline for application: May 31st, 2008<br />Contact info: <a href="mailto:cei@fm-kp.si?subject=MoodleMoot%202008">cei@fm-kp.si</a><br /><br /></b><b><span style="color: rgb(42, 52, 127);">About the conference<br /><br /></span></b>Last year the Faculty of Management decided to host the first Slovenian Moodle conference (also known as a MoodleMoot) to bring together users, developers and administrators of Moodle, one of the most popular online learning management systems in Slovenia.
