I admit: I've been a bad blogger lately. I've been tagged for my first blog <a href="http://thedailymeme.com/what-is-a-meme/">meme</a> over 3 weeks ago, and I still haven't done my homework :blushes: I'm glad that I can now finally take some time to add my post to the <a href="http://www.alexshalman.com/blog/2007/03/23/gotta-get-goals">Gotta Get Goals Meme</a>, for which I was tagged by <a href="http://onlinesapiens.com/blog/2007/05/19/my-goals-gotta-get-goals-meme/">Eduardo Peirano</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(also, check out his </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://college2.ning.com/">College 2.0</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> network on </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span>, who also wanted to learn about my goals.<br /><br />I admit it took me some time to write this post. I'm in a way at a turning point of my life - just got my bachelor degree, and now I'm trying to get a full time job and continue with my formal education. And although I'll probably continue in the field I'm already so involved in, it certainly is a good time for me to think about goals, and all the things I'd like to do in the future.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/540752325/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 490px; height: 208px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1289/540752325_9cdeed8b4f.jpg" alt="Gotta Get Goals" /></a></div>So, after much thought, I have decided that these are the most interesting goals for me right now:<br /><ul><li>I'd like <span style="font-weight: bold;">stay on track</span> with recent developments and best practices in the the field of e-learning, and also in other fields that can help me with my work or are just interesting for me (for example informatics, psychology, communication science, marketing, graphic design,...). My goal is to keep my eyes open for new discoveries, to keep reading, keep asking questions, meeting new people, learning something new every single day, and trying to apply new knowledge both to my professional and personal life.</li><li>I'd also like to <span style="font-weight: bold;">continue with my formal education</span>. My goal is to find a good online master and later a doctoral program connected with e-learning, during which I'll be able to improve myself as an online learner, and of course continue to reflect on my work as an online tutor.<br /></li><li>I'd like to continuously <span style="font-weight: bold;">improve my tutoring and teaching skills</span>, and try to share my passion for my work with my students, colleagues, and anybody else that is willing to listen ;) With that I'd like to inspire people to discover new things that are not necessarily related to a single course subject, and to start viewing the process of learning as a daily activity and not just as part of a formal educational setting.</li><li>I'm my lifetime I'd also like to <span style="font-weight: bold;">learn another foreign language </span>- currently I know English and Italian (although I need to improve my speaking and writing skills in Italian!), and I would once like to learn a language that is completely different from the languages that I already know. Currently, Japanese looks the most tempting for me. Why? Because it is something entirely new, because it'd also give me the opportunity to get to know a different culture, and because it would enable me to watch Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">anime</a> in the original language :)</li><li>I'd also to <span style="font-weight: bold;">continue blogging </span>and make my blog an interesting place to visit at least once a week :) Although blogging takes a lot of time and effort, it gives back so many wonderful rewards that I certainly hope I'll be able to actively use my blog as my starting point for learning for as long as possible.<br /></li><li>And at last but certainly not least, I'd also like to <span style="font-weight: bold;">continue making the lives of people closest to me</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my family and closest friends - you know who you are)</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">brighter</span> with tiny thoughtful displays of affection that show them that I care about them and that they are special for me. By doing this I'd also like to thank them day by day for all their love and support - because that in the end is what fuels all my passions and makes me go on.</li></ul><a href="http://onlinesapiens.com/blog/2007/05/19/my-goals-gotta-get-goals-meme/">Eduardo</a> already tagged some people I'd have wanted to tag, but one person he didn't tag, and I would like to learn more about, is <a href="http://webtoolsforlearners.blogspot.com/">Joan</a> <a href="http://eduspaces.net/vinall/weblog/">Vinall-Cox</a>.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/06/gotta-get-goals-meme.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/06/gotta-get-goals-meme.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
