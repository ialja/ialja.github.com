The Moot was hosted at <a href="http://www.fm-kp.si/eng/">my faculty</a>, and we had over 60 delegates from all over our country (and also abroad). We were able to listen to over 30 interesting presentations, during which we learned about how <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle</a> is being used in different schools, at different levels, and for different course subjects. It was also a great opportunity to meet new people, exchange ideas, and also have a great time on the Slovenian coast (we managed to arrange a nice, warm and sunny day ;) ).<br /><br />Most of the conference was in Slovenian, but we also had an international section, in which our Austrian and Italian friends presented their work. I was especially excited about having our <a href="http://www.act2win.com/">Austrian friends</a> over, whom we actually met through <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=65151">moodle.org</a>! Thank you so much <a href="http://www.act2win.com/index.php?id=ps0">Peter</a> and <a href="http://www.act2win.com/index.php?id=team0&no_cache=1&amp;sword_list%5B%5D=sabrina&sword_list%5B%5D=ovcak">Sabrina</a> for coming and presenting some of your work! :)<br /><br />Here is a photo from the beginning of the international section, with me as the section moderator, and Peter and Sabrina preparing for their presentation, which was supported by <a href="http://www.persony.com/">Persony</a>, a really great web conferencing tool:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rk7n6AOtFTI/AAAAAAAAAFE/K7tC68QrQNg/s1600-h/DSC_0025_w.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rk7n6AOtFTI/AAAAAAAAAFE/K7tC68QrQNg/s320/DSC_0025_w.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5066241614518490418" border="0" /></a><div align="center"><i>Photo by Alen Je≈æovnik</i></div><br />At the conference I also presented my own paper on the subject of <a href="http://www.sloodle.com/">Sloodle</a>. My presentation was the last of the day, and I think I did a decent job - judging from the feedback from the audience and their questions :) After the conference I also had a brief presentation of <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> for those that were interested, and I hope I managed to present the existing potential of virtual worlds well enough.<br /><br />So, the event was delivered without any major problems, and I think that all of our delegates were able to find something useful at our first Moodle Moot. I definitely hope we'll have another event like this again in the next year.<br /><br />I'd like to finish this report by posting my own Sloodle presentation, and the two videos I've used during my presentation (I only had 10 minutes to present everything, so I had to keep the videos short). Here are the slides I used (translated in English):<br /><div align="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=51939&doc=sloodle-presentation-6650" height="348" width="425"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=51939&amp;doc=sloodle-presentation-6650"></object></div><br />A short video about Second Life (it was played on slide 3):<br /><div align="center"><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tKyU0cj7dcE"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tKyU0cj7dcE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></div><br />And a short demonstration of how the Sloodle Toolbar works (played on slide 7):<br /><div align="center"><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7fOpqdHaU18"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/7fOpqdHaU18" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></div><br /><span style="color: rgb(192, 192, 192);">(By the way: we also had my <a href="/2007/05/moodle-presentation-feedback-needed.html">Moodle presentation video</a> playing in the coffee room and before the start of the conference.)</span><br /><br />If you'd like to know more about our conference or my presentation, please leave a comment here or email me (ialja(at)mac(dot)com).<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/report-first-slovenian-moodle-moot.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/report-first-slovenian-moodle-moot.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
