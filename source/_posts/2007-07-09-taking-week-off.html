<div class='post'>
Just a short notice: I'm taking this week off for a short vacation at the sea. I'll have internet access, but I'll try to avoid it if possible (my wrists really need some rest), thought I'll probably post little updates on <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>. I already have some great books packed, and I really can't wait to relax on the beach and enjoy the sea air. I'll be back in the digital world next week, so stay tuned! :)<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/758876237/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 347px; height: 262px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1140/758876237_a0ff22aa79.jpg" alt="Sunset in Koper" /></a></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/taking-week-off.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/taking-week-off.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
