<div style="text-align: left;">Ah, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/" target="_blank">Dashboard</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/" target="_blank">Widgets</a> are certainly one of my favorite features of Mac OS X. There are many more or less useful tools disguised as widgets, so I've decided to post a list of my favorite, essential widgets that increase my productivity or just keep me company ;)<br /><br />Here are the widgets I keep in my Dashboard at all times:<br /></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/applelogo.html" target="_blank">Apple Logo</a> - it's just an Apple logo that makes my Dashboard a bit more pretty ;) You can choose your favorite Apple logo color or pattern (my choice is Snow).</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculator</span> - a simple calculator that comes with the OS.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calendar</span> - as the name explains, it's a calendar and it comes with the OS.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dictionary</span> - comes with the OS and lets you search the built-in dictionary.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/business/dobedo.html" target="_blank">DoBeDo</a> - a widget that shows tasks (ToDos) from iCal. It has many settings, skins, and enables editing and printing of tasks.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/calculate_convert/easycurrency.html" target="_blank">Easy Currency</a> - a currency converter with many different currencies (even Slovenian tolar). A must for me now that we'll be switching to Euros.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/business/icalevents.html" target="_blank">iCal Events</a> - as the name explains, this widget shows future events from iCal. A great match for DoBeDo (I even use the same skin for both widgets).</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/movie_tv/movielocator.html" target="_blank">Movie Locator</a> - type in a movie title and Safari will open the movie's IMDB page.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/business/screenshotplus.html" target="_blank">Screenshot Plus</a> - a great widget for making screenshots without having to remember all those screenshot shortcuts of Mac OS X. You can take screenshots of the entire screen, a widget, a window or part of the screen. The widget also has a preview option.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stickies</span> - an electronic version of PostIt notes that comes with the OS. One of the most useful widgets for me. Currently I have 4 different stickies on my Dashboard (each is of course of a different color).</li><li><a href="http://microcore.dk/TheDailyGrind/" target="_blank">TheDailyGrind</a> - a great widget to keep track of time spent on different projects.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weather</span> - well... it's a weather widget :) It comes with the OS and I just love its look.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/reference/wikipedia.html" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> - search Wikipedia on your Dashboard with this widget.</li></ul><div style="text-align: left;">Useful widgets that I call only when I need them:<br /></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/colourmod.html" target="_blank">ColourMod</a> - a sleek widget that lets you pick a color and displays the color's values in HSV, RGB, Hex, CMYK.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/developer/htmltidywidget.html" target="_blank">HTML Tidy Widget</a> - this widget checks HTML code and ads missing tags or points out errors in the code.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/status/ichrono.html" target="_blank">iChrono</a> - a cool stopwatch.</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/news/newsreader.html" target="_blank">News Reader</a> - an RSS reader that can display RSS feeds from multiple sources. I now use Safari as my RSS reader, but this widget is pretty cool as well.</li></ul><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/essential-widgets-list.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/essential-widgets-list.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
