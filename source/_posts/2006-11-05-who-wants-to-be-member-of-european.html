Coming from Poland there's an new online game that imitates the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/default.htm" target="_blank">European Parliament</a>. In the game players from EU (and other) countries can discuss current issues, join political fractions, cast their votes and much more. You can read more about this game in <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/039-12151-296-10-43-906-20061025STO12150-2006-23-10-2006/default_en.htm" target="_blank">this article</a> or on the game site: <a href="http://www.bemep.eu/" target="_blank">http://www.bemep.eu/</a>. Supposedly there will also be e-learning lessons that will teach participants about EU politics, though non are currently available.<br /><br />As you can guess, I already signed up for the game and taken a look around. I am still looking for a fraction that promotes e-learning to join - or maybe I'll just create my own e-learning/geek fraction ;) Jokes apart - I think the game is a great EU initiative that will hopefully help us to learn more about the mysterious EU politics and build a stronger EU identity.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/who-wants-to-be-member-of-european.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/who-wants-to-be-member-of-european.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
