<div class='post'>
What happens when you fill 2 classrooms and 1 big conference room at <a href="http://en.telekom.si/">Telekom Slovenije</a> with over 70 girls of all ages, who want to build their own web app, and 30 coaches, experienced web developers? No, it's not a rhetorical question, it's a real challenge!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vkCHcmWd2Bg/UM72ZDyLCyI/AAAAAAAAAos/mo_g7PzdImg/s1600/219146_482121458493804_716264997_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vkCHcmWd2Bg/UM72ZDyLCyI/AAAAAAAAAos/mo_g7PzdImg/s400/219146_482121458493804_716264997_o.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Over a hundred people at the first Rails Girls Ljubljana workshop! Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Sure, the girls are among the most enthusiastic out of the <a href="http://visual.ly/rails-girls-ljubljana-december-2012-english-version">586 that signed</a>&nbsp;up for <a href="http://railsgirls.com/ljubljana">Rails Girls Ljubljana</a>, a free two-day workshop. But most of them have no experience with programming whatsoever. And the coaches sure are all excited to help and hope to see more girls among their ranks, yet most of them have little or no experience with teaching, especially with teaching complete beginners. Even after more than a month of intensive planning, countless emails and meetings, I, as the main organizer, can't help but feel nervous on Friday, December 14, the first day of the first ever Rails Girls Ljubljana. Is anyone even going to show up?<br /><!-- more --><br />The doubts and worries dissipate once I see all those smiling faces. Once I see the coaches interacting with the girls. Patiently answering all questions, making sure <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/">everything is installed</a> successfully and ready to go for the workshop. You can feel the excitement and positive energy in the air!<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">3,2,1... in gremooooo, punce! <a href="http://t.co/zIPk6WPi" title="http://twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/status/279636337550843905/photo/1">twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/…</a><br />— RailsGirls Ljubljana (@RailsGirls_LJ) <a data-datetime="2012-12-14T17:17:53+00:00" href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/status/279636337550843905">December 14, 2012</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />The next day, Saturday, December 15, I wake up an hour before the alarm goes off. My mind keeps running through the to-dos, making last minute plans. The nervousness has already been replaced by excitement. Fueled by the positive energy of the day before, I can't wait to welcome the participants in the morning. A lot of them arrive early, also eager to start and get the first dose of coffee.<br /><br />After breakfast we start by welcoming everybody, but I try to keep the intro short. I can't wait to hear our motivational talks by two great girl geeks. <a href="https://twitter.com/sparkica">Mateja</a> tells them about how programming will probably make them feel like Alice in Wonderland, but also highlights the thrill of programming, the joy of <i>creating</i> something on your own out of code. Dunja then takes over to remind us of the rich history of women in programming. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bEur79eYw4o/UM74edH3lDI/AAAAAAAAAo8/g2og-6GANgY/s1600/316607_482120485160568_1640987580_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bEur79eYw4o/UM74edH3lDI/AAAAAAAAAo8/g2og-6GANgY/s400/316607_482120485160568_1640987580_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Hana making sure our motivational talks get recorded!&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Both talks make a great introduction to the practical part of the day. I first explain how the internet works and what we'll be doing during the workshop using <a href="/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html">Octocat, sushi and sushi chefs</a>. The smiles on the girls' faces are a good sign, although I also see some traces of doubts "Will I really be able to do that?".<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmXneBGpD14/UM73Ycmo3rI/AAAAAAAAAo0/Njx-IX_4akI/s1600/68657_482120785160538_711443265_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="399" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmXneBGpD14/UM73Ycmo3rI/AAAAAAAAAo0/Njx-IX_4akI/s400/68657_482120785160538_711443265_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Explaining objects and methods with a lot of waving around :) Photo by: <a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a>&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We play with <a href="http://tryruby.org/">TryRuby.org</a> a bit and then learn how to Google everything with the <a href="http://blog.railsgirls.com/post/20405930015/bentobox-learn-the-language-of-technology">Bento Box exercise</a>. But that's just about enough theory, the girls want to get their own hands dirty with code! Without further ado, they form small groups of maximum three participants and start creating their <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/">idea app</a> with the help of their coach.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lPQz8L9YktE/UM74fCAYqDI/AAAAAAAAApA/CgIrPcxv_QQ/s1600/380677_482120988493851_1888856434_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="386" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lPQz8L9YktE/UM74fCAYqDI/AAAAAAAAApA/CgIrPcxv_QQ/s400/380677_482120988493851_1888856434_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Making sense of the technical mambo jumbo during the Bento Box exercise.&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is when the magic happens! There is no other way to describe it. I walk around and all the girls have their Terminal windows open and are building their first app. The coaches are also in the zone, explaining everything, even drawing some of the most abstract concepts on whiteboards.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HLHiffWKyQI/UM74hLRIoPI/AAAAAAAAApY/DZRp_9Bfd18/s1600/60892_482121105160506_1144614278_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HLHiffWKyQI/UM74hLRIoPI/AAAAAAAAApY/DZRp_9Bfd18/s400/60892_482121105160506_1144614278_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of the rooms, full of girls and coaches.&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>We have a hard time making everyone wrap up for lunch. I hear girls and coaches talking abut their apps while waiting in line. The girls seem especially eager to finish fast and get back to their code!<br /><br />Food obviously makes us all a bit sleepy, so we guide everyone outside for a good dose of fresh air, a quick stretch and we finally do our <a href="http://fridayhug.com/">#FridayHug</a> group shot. There are so many of us we hardly fit into a single frame!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FEIEhhwjspU/UM79gyXUDHI/AAAAAAAAAp4/YB-BSwnERss/s1600/8848_482121291827154_160897704_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FEIEhhwjspU/UM79gyXUDHI/AAAAAAAAAp4/YB-BSwnERss/s640/8848_482121291827154_160897704_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Building a wep app.&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>After the group shot the girls return straight to their laptops and continue working on their apps. It doesn't take long for some groups to reach the "What's Next?" part of the guide. Before the workshop is over, some have already added comments, ratings, deployed their app online with Heroku, some are playing with CSS or working on special assignments their coaches gave them. By 6 PM everyone has their own web app. We are all tired, but happy and excited. The girls, the coaches are all thanking me for a great experience as asking me: "When are we going to do this again?"<br /><br />"After I get some sleep," I smile. There is no other choice. <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> will happen again in Ljubljana, probably in other cities in Slovenia as well. Girls want to code, coaches (boys and girls!) are eager to help them out. We still don't know exactly how and when, but we have to do this again. For all those girls (over 500 of them) who couldn't be with us this time, for all those girls who haven't even heard of us yet or maybe who didn't dare to fill in the signup form. We will be back.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PZlbI9WgUgw/UM74fg9mh2I/AAAAAAAAApI/nMkXI1LuevE/s1600/532527_482121845160432_2111096409_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PZlbI9WgUgw/UM74fg9mh2I/AAAAAAAAApI/nMkXI1LuevE/s400/532527_482121845160432_2111096409_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Happy Rails Girls and coaches!&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a>&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>And we're also hoping to keep in touch with the 1st generation of Rails Girls and coaches. We already have a support group on Facebook running, maybe we'll even organize regular informal meetups to check everyone's progress.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iEqZN2ZM4uk/UM74hzoMMZI/AAAAAAAAApk/TOTLuLyzKFw/s1600/74069_482121261827157_1147127405_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="386" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iEqZN2ZM4uk/UM74hzoMMZI/AAAAAAAAApk/TOTLuLyzKFw/s400/74069_482121261827157_1147127405_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lots of love and positive energy!&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Finally, I would like to thank everyone who made this event such a magic experience. <a href="http://www.alesspetic.si/">Aleš</a>, our digital champion and the leading force of <a href="http://www.tsstartup.si/">TSstartup</a> accelerator (where I currently work as a community manager), for offering me the challenge of organizing the event and supporting us along the way. <a href="https://twitter.com/alivea">Živa</a> for all your support and the super awesome <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> t-shirt, <a href="https://twitter.com/AjdaAzman">Ajda</a> for all your energy and help, <a href="https://twitter.com/tadejab">Tadeja</a> for the great texts and tweets, <a href="https://twitter.com/RokPiletic">Rok</a> for surprising us with handmade heart-shaped desserts, <a href="https://twitter.com/anjalazar">Anja</a> for hosting two thirds of the Croatian team.

Mateja and Dunja for doing their talk twice in both our classrooms and for motivating the girls.&nbsp;Hana from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.viidea.com/">Viidea</a>&nbsp;who filmed the lectures,&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina</a>&nbsp;for great event photos (you can see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/RailsGirlsLjubljana/photos_stream">more on our Facebook page</a>). All the participants for your braveness, persistence and curiosity. <a href="https://twitter.com/lindaliukas">Linda</a> for sending us a lovely greeting video (unfortunately we couldn't play it due to audio problems) and for starting Rails Girls in the first place. Even though I wasn't a participant at the workshop, I learned a lot in the past month or so. I got to know GitHub and met so many great people along the way. Thank you all, and I hope to see you next time!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
