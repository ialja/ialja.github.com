Hello world! Today I finally returned online after an offline week in Egypt (how was it? Well, let me just say that the words "hot weather" now have an entirely new meaning for me :) ). And I already spent most of the morning answering e-mails, sending out Joost invites <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(if you need one for yourself or your friends you can still mail me - ialja(at)mac(dot)com)</span>, updating Second Life, and getting through messages from various Web 2.0 sites. While I was gone <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/sloodle-presentation/">my Sloodle presentation</a> even became <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/featured">featured on Slideshare</a>! I guess it shows that the Web 2.0 never sleeps :)<br /><br />For me the past week has been quite odd. Time passed slowly, and differently. I spent an entire week without using a computer, and even with limited use of my cell phone. It was strange, but in a way it was good to take a short break. The only problem is that I've got so much to catch up on :( This week will be also very busy for me, so I don't think I'll manage to post to my blog in the next days. I know I still have some blog homework to do, but I'm afraid it will have to wait for at least another week... Until then you can take a look at some photos from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ialja/sets/72157600275805854/">my vacation on Flickr</a>.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/517391456/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/208/517391456_77b64b70f6_m.jpg" alt="Camel riding" height="180" width="240" /></a></div>Yeah, I know, I am quite hopeless: one of the first things I did upon my return was to upload some photos to Flickr. Yup, it's good to be back! :)  So... stay tuned ;)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/back-from-offline-week.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/05/back-from-offline-week.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
