If you don't know where to go or what to try next on the web, I suggest checking out these sites:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://popurls.com/" target="_blank">Popurls</a> - want to know the latest news, pics, videos on the web? That's a site that can help you.</li><li><a href="http://www.go2web20.net/" target="_blank">Go2Web20.net</a> - self-named complete Web 2.0 directory. A great starting point to find interactive Web 2.0 sites!</li></ul>Yep,  these two sites can really keep you busy! :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/feeling-lost-on-web.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/feeling-lost-on-web.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
