We're all naturally curious beings, but our day to day lives often get stuck in predictable routines that can dull our minds. And what's a great way to wake up our curiosity? <b>The unexpected</b><b>.</b> Something that makes us pause and wonder, something that requires us to reconsider what we know about the world.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Like the company that added the <a href="http://www.serviceuntitled.com/a-wake-up-call-for-bored-customers/2009/10/08/">ability to hear a duck quack</a> when calling their toll-free number. Or <a href="http://thefuntheory.com/">The Fun Theory initiative</a>, which among others included the world's deepest bin to motivate people to throw garbage into the trash bin. Take a look below and pay attention to people's reactions.</div><div align="center"><br /><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/cbEKAwCoCKw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/cbEKAwCoCKw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br /></div><div>I love this example because it shows a lot of people inspecting the bin, trying to figure out how it works. </div><div><br /></div><div>And that makes me wonder why is there so little of such wonder in our schools? The place, where such behavior should be expected; the people in the video above show a very clear desire to <i>understand</i> the bin, to <i>learn</i> why it behaves in an unexpected way. Do our students have such a desire to learn in our schools? And if not, what can we do to bring the unexpected and the wonder in our schools?</div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/10/power-of-unexpected.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/10/power-of-unexpected.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
