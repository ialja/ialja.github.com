So, what can you do if you're stuck on Windows and want to use Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/" target="_blank">Dashboard</a> Widgets? You can go to <a href="http://www.widgetop.com/" target="_blank">Widgetop</a> - a site that imitates Mac OS X widgets in your browsers (the site supposedly works best with <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>). The whole thing isn't as pretty as the real thing of course, but if you want pretty you stick to Mac OS X ;)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/apple-dashboard-widgets-on-windows.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/apple-dashboard-widgets-on-windows.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
