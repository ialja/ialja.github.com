Just a brief announcement and invitation: I was invited to be the guest of the next ISTE Speaker Series Session in Second Life on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tuesday, February 19, 6 PM SLT</span>. I'll be talking about my experience of being an online tutor and I hope you can join me for a great discussion. Here's the official announcement from the <a href="http://secondlife.iste.wikispaces.net/events">ISTE Second Life wiki</a>:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Online Tutoring Across Different Platforms </span>with Alja Sulčič (SL: iAlja Writer)<br />Alja is a virtual platform expert in Slovenia working for Artesia, a small start-up focused on building virtual communities. Prior to joining Artesia she was an online tutor at the Faculty of Management Koper at University of Primorska for three years. She will be presenting about her experience as an online tutor in an online e-business course in which students were introduced to different internet technologies, from Moodle to Second Life, and about the challenges of working with emerging technologies in general. Alja is a member of the Second Life Volunteer Program, working mostly with new Slovenian Second Life users.</blockquote><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);" href="http://www.blogger.com/www.iste.org/secondlife/">ISTE</a> hosts great regular events, so you might want to check out their wiki for announcements for other events as well or check out <a href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/">Kevin Jarrett's blog</a> for great posts about what's going on at ISTE Second Life HQ. I must admit I haven't yet managed to attend any of their events in person <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(6 PM SLT means 3 AM for me! :( )</span>, but I've heard great things about them. So, hope to see you on Tuesday!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2008/02/iste-speakers-series-session-in-second.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2008/02/iste-speakers-series-session-in-second.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
