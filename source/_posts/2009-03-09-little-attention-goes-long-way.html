<div class='post'>
I recently celebrated my birthday, and one of the most memorable greetings came from quite an unexpected source: the business social networking site <a href="http://www.xing.com/">Xing</a>. I received an e-mail informing me that they are giving me 10 days of Premium Membership. That in itself is a nice touch, but what really brought a smile to my face was the picture of a Xing cake with my name on it that was attached to the message.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SbVhmeqSVdI/AAAAAAAAAXk/oyJfRVESZ7s/s1600-h/xing+cake.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 256px; height: 278px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SbVhmeqSVdI/AAAAAAAAAXk/oyJfRVESZ7s/s320/xing+cake.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5311258649246717394" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">My own virtual cake! Yummy! :)</span><br /></div>Technologically speaking, it was nothing special; it's quite simple to program a piece of software that does this for every member's birthday. But still; Xing took the time to think of a special way to wish their members a happy birthday, and it certainly worked for me. I confess that I don't even use Xing regularly, but this simple gestures has increased my appreciation for the site. An unexpected and original display of affection can certainly go a long way. Can you remember when was the last time you tried to do something different, unexpected, something personal for your customers/students/friends?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/03/little-attention-goes-long-way.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/03/little-attention-goes-long-way.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
