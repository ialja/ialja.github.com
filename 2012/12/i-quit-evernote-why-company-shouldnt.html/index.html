<a href="/2010/08/7-things-i-love-about-evernote.html" title="/2010/08/7-things-i-love-about-evernote.html">I used to love Evernote</a>. &#8220;Remember everything&#8221; is their headline. People talk about &#8220;outsourcing your memory&#8221; with Evernote. And I did. I made Evernote the hub for most of my work that didn&#8217;t require documents. I stored everything, from meeting notes and blog post drafts to notes about our cats&#8217; health and even kept a shared notebook for our favorite recipes. <br /><p>One of the things I loved most about Evernote was its ability to keep all my notes synced across multiple devices. Sounds great, doesn&#8217;t it? Yeah, except things don&#8217;t &#8220;just work&#8221; anymore. </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OCL2l1Vozc8/UNYA6qqypOI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/E3YhmHfJiBE/s1600/goodbye-evernote.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="215" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OCL2l1Vozc8/UNYA6qqypOI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/E3YhmHfJiBE/s320/goodbye-evernote.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><!-- more --><br /><h2>How Evernote started ruining meetings for me </h2><br />It&#8217;s not a new problem. I first started having problems this Summer. I like to prepare for meetings in advance, so I spent some time jotting down notes in Evernote in the evening. I was a bit of a hurry to get to the meeting the next morning, so I didn&#8217;t bother to press the Sync button on Evernote on my iMac. I&#8217;ve always had automatic syncing on, so I didn&#8217;t really think twice about it.<br /><br />Except I should have. On the bus I took out my iPhone to revise the agenda for the meeting. Tough luck. The note isn&#8217;t there, and neither are all the other notes I knew I created the day before, even a couple of days before! Of course, I have no way to remotely push the Evernote Sync button on my iMac, so I improvise and try to recreate the notes from memory. Luckily I hadn&#8217;t yet completely outsourced my memory to Evernote despite being a Premium user, so I was able to remember most of it.<br /><br /><h2>Do elephants run Evernote support?</h2><br />The first thing I did when I got back home was to check my Evernote settings. Everything was as it should had been, automatic sync every 5 minutes. I try to manually sync, and the notes then appear on my iPhone. Ok, time to contact Evernote support. <br /><br />As a Premium user I did get a response within the business day, but I can&#8217;t say it was very useful. I sent them the activity log and they recommended reinstalling Evernote. No other explanation. Was this a recurring problem? Just a faulty installation? How can I check that the next time? I suggested they implement a sync checker into the app that would actually tell the user automatic syncing has failed. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t really have a habit of checking apps logs when I except the app to just work. In fact, I didn&#8217;t even know Evernote had an Activity Log before I ran into problems.<br /><br /><h2>Evernote works fine if you&#8217;re using just one device</h2><br />Back to my story. Time goes by. I replace my iMac with a MacBook Pro and spend most of the time on the same machine. Meaning, I&#8217;m mostly using Evernote on one device. I still like the idea of being able to access notes from anywhere if I need to. However, the few times I do use the Evernote mobile apps, they display weird sync behavior. I don&#8217;t pay much attention to the issue as I now always have my laptop with me during meetings. So I decide to stick with Evernote for the time being and renew my subscription on December 1.<br /><br />As an Evernote user, I&#8217;m glad to see them release a big update to all their apps this Fall. The mobile one certainly has some nice tricks up its sleeve, like the sync button that&#8217;s now easily accessible on the first screen (yep, that wasn&#8217;t the case before). The Mac app is bloated and takes some time getting used to, but at least I can still access my notes and write them as before. Changes happen, so I don&#8217;t make a big deal out of this.<br /><br />Until yesterday, when I decide to only take my iPad to work. And guess what? I want to look up something in Evernote and notice that all notes from over a week ago are missing. I press the sync button over and over again, on my iPad, on my iPhone. Nope. The notes just aren&#8217;t in the cloud. And that is where my patience ends.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Are regular reinstalls the only way to make Evernote sync?</h2><br />I contact support again, specifically asking them not to serve me with an automated reply like last time. I want to talk to a human that can actually explain what&#8217;s going one. But no, no such luck. Either they have machines answering the tickets or their support staff has very strict guidelines on what they can and cannot write. Meanwhile I&#8217;ve had very good experience with Nike Store support, you can see they are actual humans working there. You know, with emotions and the ability to write unique sentences.<br /><br />Anyhow, the official Evernote answer is that I appear to be running an old version of the app (after sending the ticket the latest update showed up in the Mac App Store) and that I should reinstall Evernote. Same reply I got last time, same instruction on how to reinstall the app (as if that was so difficult on a Mac&#8230;), yet they still haven&#8217;t figured out Evernote now lives in the Mac App Store.<br /><br /><h2>Goodbye Evernote, hello alternatives!</h2><br />Dear Evernote, I just don&#8217;t want to talk to support bots anymore. I don&#8217;t need a bloated app that looks pretty. I want to write notes and have them in sync on all my devices. Which is why <b>I </b><strong>cancelled my Evernote Premium subscription yesterday and started looking for alternatives</strong>.<br /><br />I looked at <a href="http://springpad.com/" title="http://springpad.com/">Springpad</a> - but they have no Mac client. I looked at <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/" title="http://simplenoteapp.com">Simplenote</a> - but apparently they&#8217;ve been having sync issues for a while now as well. And the more I looked, the more I started seeing <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" title="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> mentioned as an alternative! Dropbox? Yeah, you can easily have a folder for Notes, keep them in .txt or .rtf format and edit them practically anywhere. In TextEdit, for instance, which is one of the Apple apps I use most often on my Mac. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jU0z3W5fi8U/UNYE6kSA12I/AAAAAAAAAqw/NGlEn91YDXo/s1600/springpad-simplenote-dropbox-mobile-apps.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="120" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jU0z3W5fi8U/UNYE6kSA12I/AAAAAAAAAqw/NGlEn91YDXo/s400/springpad-simplenote-dropbox-mobile-apps.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />And as I started considering this alternative, I started discovering more and more note taking apps that can sync with Dropbox, even <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/" title="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>. Sure, they don&#8217;t have all the fancy stuff Evernote has, but I rarely use tags after I assign them, and I&#8217;ve only needed audio notes once in the last year. Most of my notes are text notes. I already use <a href="/2012/01/im-in-love-with-pinterest-and-why-that.html">Pinterest for visual bookmarking</a>, and Springpad seems like a really nice complementary service for that. It has a great mobile app and it&#8217;s very easy to have a private collection of more visually based notes and share them with my husband. For free!<br /><br />So, I realize that instead of a full blown alternative to Evernote what I really need is a bloat-free app that enables me to write, has just a few of the basic formatting options (bold, italic, the ability to make links).<br /><br /><h2>I&#8217;m in love with the simplicity of iA Writer</h2><br />And this is where I discover <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/" title="http://www.iawriter.com">iA Writer</a>. Well, discover is not really the right word here. I was aware of the app before, but I thought it was just for fancy writing stuff, a more simple version of Pages. But it turns out it now has both iCloud and Dropbox sync, a gorgeously simple native Mac app and an equally simple iOS client that works for both iPhone and iPad. The runner up was <a href="http://bywordapp.com/" title="http://bywordapp.com">Byword</a>, another simple text editor both for Macs and iOS devices. Both of these apps focus on writing text in an uncluttered way, and both support <a href="http://support.iawriter.com/help/kb/general-questions/markdown-syntax-reference-guide" title="http://support.iawriter.com/help/kb/general-questions/markdown-syntax-reference-guide">Markdown</a> for basic text formatting. And oh, they also make it easier to prepare text for the web, HTML tags and all. Bingo!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/33964031?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="500"></iframe> <br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/33964031">iA Writer now with iCloud</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/ia">Oliver Reichenstein</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><h2>iCloud and Dropbox to the rescue</h2><br />Yeah, I know, I&#8217;m quite biased. All the gadgets I use were designed by Apple in California (and Assembled in China, of course), so I didn&#8217;t blink twice because there&#8217;s no Android or Windows support in either of these apps. However! I did manage to export all my notes from Evernote to Dropbox using <a href="https://www.cloudhq.net/">cloudHQ</a> in .txt format, which means I can access and edit them anywhere. And while I&#8217;ll be using iCloud in iA Writer for notes I am using the most (offline ability tipped the scale), I&#8217;ll keep using Dropbox as a storage/backup tool for less frequently used notes. Spotlight will make sure I can easily find old notes in the Notes folder on my Dropbox.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iEsxNDNvWcA/UNYC-_-VbjI/AAAAAAAAAqg/rz0BvazfO44/s1600/icloud-dropbox.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="130" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iEsxNDNvWcA/UNYC-_-VbjI/AAAAAAAAAqg/rz0BvazfO44/s320/icloud-dropbox.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Sure, the solution might not be as elegant as using Evernote for everything, but iCloud and Dropbox syncing has so far been good to me. And I can use the 40â‚¬/year I&#8217;ll be saving for not using Evernote anymore on expanded iCloud storage if I need to (as a legacy MobileMe member I still have more than enough space, but expanding storage might come in handy if I start using iCloud more intensively in various apps).<br /><br /><h2>TL;DR: Evernote, make sure your core functionality works before focusing on the looks!</h2><br />And with that, dear Evernote, I am saying my official goodbyes. I have fond memories of you, we&#8217;ve had some good times together. But I just can&#8217;t watch anymore as your apps get prettier and prettier and your core functionality lies forgotten in the dust. A quick Google search showed I&#8217;m not the only one with this problem. And I&#8217;m just not willing to reinstall your app once in a while to make sure it works properly. I&#8217;m not playing the Evernote lottery (&#8220;Will my notes be synced today?&#8221;) anymore.<br /><br />Mind you, I&#8217;m not complaining about a free service here, I&#8217;m complaining about a service I pay for and it&#8217;s just not working as advertised. Goodbye, Evernote. I am moving on, to more simple (and cheaper) solutions. I&#8217;ll just make sure all notes were migrated properly and then I&#8217;ll gladly uninstall your app from my Mac, as per your instructions, <strong>permanently</strong>.<br /><br /><i><b>Update:</b> Well, one thing Evernote support did right was to refund my account for the yearly subscription. Thanks, I guess, though I would rather have a functional product I was more than happy to pay for.&nbsp;</i><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/i-quit-evernote-why-company-shouldnt.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/i-quit-evernote-why-company-shouldnt.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
