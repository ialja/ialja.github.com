  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yes, I know it&#8217;s been awhile since my last blog post - but rest assured, I haven&#8217;t forgotten about my blog, it&#8217;s just that lately I&#8217;ve been dedicating more time to other social channels, especially <a href="http://twitter.com/iAlja">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=655122783">Facebook</a>, and of course also my <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. I really believe that you have to get immersed in any new technology in order to really understand it and be able to figure out why it works for so many people.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.facebook.com/"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 137px; height: 50px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R0latsTla-I/AAAAAAAAAKk/ispS-0UUrAE/s320/facebook+logo.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5136736591026678754" border="0" /></a>I already wrote about what I believe to be <a href="/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html">the magic behind Twitter</a>, and today I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my thoughts on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Facebook</span>. I decided to choose this subject not only because I find Facebook quite fascinating, but also because there are a lot of people out there wondering what FB is all about and what it should/can be used for. In fact, FB might seem pretty straightforward, but it can take some time to figure it out. And that is why I&#8217;ve decided to share my personal experience with FB.<br /><br />Ok, let&#8217;s just start with <span style="font-weight: bold;">the basics</span>. As you probably know, FB is a very popular social networking site, which enables you to create your profile and connect with friends. In addition to this, it has its own <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">developer platform</a>, which developers can use to build different applications that enable users to do more or less useful activities. Yes, these apps only work in the closed environment of FB, making the site almost some kind of web operating system that doesn&#8217;t want to talk to the rest of the web on its own, but requires developers to learn its language <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(called </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/FBML">FBML</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> to bring the magic of the web and social interactions to it. Not surprisingly, many people criticize FB for being a walled garden, and <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is now trying hard to out open social networks with <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial</a>; but for an average Joe all this is not very relevant. If you&#8217;ve got most of your friends on FB and a lot of fun things to do, you don&#8217;t really care how it&#8217;s done, so I&#8217;ll discuss the OpenSocial vs FB platform <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(or the new FB advertising options)</span> some other time. Today, I&#8217;d just like to focus on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">user perspective about various uses of FB apps</span>, which in my opinion are the magic ingredient that make FB so appealing to an increasing number of users <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(some might add: and such a time waster ;) )</span>.<br /><br />I think we can divide FB apps, and consequently FB&#8217;s value for the users, in <span style="font-weight: bold;">three main categories</span>:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >Self-promotion and branding</span>: At its core, FB is a place where you can build your own profile. When we build an online profile, we create our online <a href="http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2007/11/gartner-says-ge.html">persona</a>, which will be seen by our friends or even the entire world. We might not realize that, but when we fill in various profile fields or choose our profile picture, we decide how we want to be presented to the world. You might want to emphasize your professional side or your fun side; but in both cases we make a choice in how we &#8220;brand&#8221; ourselves to our public <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(which we can choose by limiting our profile only to contacts for example)</span>. And there are many FB functions and apps that can help us build our persona  <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(or even our personal brand)</span>, for example: various default profile options <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(picture, interests, work &amp; education info, favorite things,&#8230;)</span>, joining groups <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the FB groups function is awful, but I find it useful to publicly express my interest in certain topics)</span>, labeling yourself as a fan of something <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(made possible by the new product pages)</span>, your choice and variety of friends, the choice of profile layout <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(choosing which info to make public, having your <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/lastfmmusic/">music playlist</a>, favorite quotes or the result of a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/personaldna/">personality test</a> displayed, &#8230;)</span>, your FB statuses, the items that appear in our mini-feed etc.. Some people even prefer having multiple profiles for different personas <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(for example, a different account for their Second Life avatar)</span>. Building our FB persona can be quite a task, and a lot of people choose to use just this aspect of FB. They register, fill in the info and connect with friends, and use FB just to say &#8220;I&#8217;m online too - if you want to connect to me use my e-mail/phone number&#8221;. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >Social play</span>: The next category of FB apps enables us to have fun and keep in touch with out friends. We all have busy lives, a lot of our friends live in different cities or even parts of the world, and it&#8217;s often not easy to find the time or way to hang out together. And here is where FB can help: it enables us to keep in touch with friend through different social <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(often playful)</span> activities. Even if you&#8217;re extremely busy, you can always find a minute or two to poke your friends, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/superpokey/">throw a sheep at them</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/zombies/">turn them into a zombie</a> or send them a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/growing/">virtual pet</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/growing/">flower</a> or <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/freegifts/">image</a>. All these apps help us say &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about you&#8221; in different ways. It might look silly, but it feels nice to receive virtual cakes when you set your status to ill. We often like to say &#8220;It&#8217;s the thought that counts&#8221;, and I think the social play apps in FB are a great proof of that. Also, the FB news feed, which displays various news about our friends, can help us feel closer to each other as it&#8217;s constantly reminding of people, telling us what they are doing and providing an easy way to interact with them <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(&#8220;Click here to hug your friend too&#8221;)</span>. Sure, the feed items are a great way for developers to promote their app, but it does have some positive side effects I&#8217;ve just mentioned.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >(Social) toolbox</span>: The last category of apps is represented by a set of utilities that can help you save time, provide useful information and even be more organized. These apps can make FB a more &#8220;serious&#8221; tool. They enable us things like <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fmailclient/">checking our e-mail</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/myoffices/">collaborating on documents</a> with friends, getting info about <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/myoffices/">weather</a>, keeping track of <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/timezones/">what time it is for our friends that live in different time zones</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my latest favorite app!)<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, displaying <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/blogfriends/">latest blog entries</a> from your friends and yourself</span></span> and much more. These apps are the main reason why people are considering using FB as a business tool or even an <a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/08/08-07-06tdc/08-07-06dnews-02.asp">e-learning tool</a>. It&#8217;s comfortable to be able to do so many different things <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(from play to work)</span> on one single site, and if we want so, we can even make our &#8220;serious&#8221; activities social by choosing to display info from utility apps on our profile, and thus provide some valuable info to our contacts <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I like to use </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.facebook.com/posted.php">FB Posted Items</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> for this purpose)</span>.</li></ul>These categories can of course often be overlapping - for example, social play apps or social toolbox apps can be used as a branding tool, and often the line between social play and social toolbox can be a fine one. An important point to remember here is that <span style="font-weight: bold;">you don&#8217;t need to use every aspect of Facebook; use what makes sense to you</span>. It&#8217;s fine if you just want to create a basic profile, and it&#8217; fine if you just want to use FB as a social toolbox and ignore the play aspects.<br /><br /><hr /><br />I&#8217;d like to conclude this post with some <span style="font-weight: bold;">basic Facebook tips</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"></span> that I hope can help you in the process of getting to know FB and finding the added value of this tool for you:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play with FB, but make sure you&#8217;ve got friends to play with.</span> Try out different apps, explore, and be curious, but try not to annoy your friends while doing that. You don&#8217;t have to send out invites to ALL of your friends for EVERY app you add (there&#8217;s always a Skip button!). Show your friends you care and know them by sending them invitations for apps that you are pretty sure will be interesting for them.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take some time to adjust your privacy settings.</span> Decide which info/activities can be public, for friends or entirely private. You can also decide whether you want your name to appear in search or not. In the future we&#8217;ll have the abilities to group friends and have different profiles for close friends, professional contacts, family etc.; but until we don&#8217;t, try to figure out the best way to present yourself to all the people on your contacts list. You might want consider using the limited profile contacts you don&#8217;t know well. You can find all these settings under the Privacy link in the upper right corner.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remember that you don&#8217;t need to have every app you use on your profile.</span> You can access apps from the left-hand menu or the application list. Removing an app box from your profile only will not delete the app, and you will still be able to receive gifts, bite chumps and do all the other *fun* activities. Your friends can often see your app info <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(for example: </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://apps.facebook.com/likeness/">Linkeness score</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> from the app itself, so there&#8217;s really no need to keep everything on your profile. I know it&#8217;s not easy, but try not to overload your profile page. When I choose what I want on my profile or not, I like to think about what info I can provide to a new friend that want to get to know me better, and what info I can provide to friends that I haven&#8217;t spoken in a while. So, to put it simply, take care of your persona, and remember that you can choose the visibility for each profile element. Some info are for friends only while you might want to have some available public.</li></ul>But of course, this post is based entirely of my Facebook experience in the past few months, and I&#8217;m sure we all have our own story to tell. So I&#8217;m really interested in hearing <span style="font-weight: bold;">your Facebook story</span>: how and why are you using FB, and what is in your opinion the added value of FB over other social networks? Also, what do you think are the best tips you could give to people just starting with FB or people still trying to figure out what the fuss is about?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/11/facebook-what-why-how.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/11/facebook-what-why-how.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday we were finally able to get our hands on the <a href="http://viewer.onrez.com/">new OnRez viewer</a> for <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> that was made for a special episode of the hit show <a href="http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/">CSI New York</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(which was also aired last night)</span>. The viewer is available both for Windows and Mac OS X and it&#8217;s got a simplified user interface and a built-it browser. If you&#8217;re familiar with the existing Linden Lab&#8217;s viewer you&#8217;ll need some time to get adjusted to some changes. The most obvious one is the fact that you now have the Friends button in the lower right corner instead of the Inventory button - I suppose they think users will need their friends&#8217; list more often then their inventory, which can now be found under a button at the top of the screen and it&#8217;s been renamed to &#8220;My Stuff&#8221; <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I don&#8217;t even want to comment on that)</span>. The good news is that most of the shortcuts still work, and you still have the client menu and all the advanced options <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(you need to manually enable the Build menu and the advanced options under the View menu)</span>.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1744653694/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 440px; height: 249px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2175/1744653694_e2e41f53bb.jpg" alt="OnRez user interface" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Some of the new UI elements (the HUD is detachable)</span></div>And even better news is that we now finally have the <span style="font-weight: bold;">back button</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and teleport history)</span> built-in. The home button in the upper menu bar is a bit confusing for me though - it takes me to Central park on the CIS sims, although the usual shortcut for home still takes me to my real home. But the best feature of all <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(at least for me)</span> is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">built-in browser</span>. Sure, it&#8217;s pretty basic <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(no Flash for example)</span>, but it works, it&#8217;s fast, easily accessible and it seems like a better way for displaying text help files than through notecards, as web pages can of course be hyperlinked and enriched with various design elements.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1743805103/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 428px; height: 241px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2320/1743805103_0726366cee.jpg" alt="My blog in the OnRez viewer" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Viewing my blog in the OnRez viewer</span></div>Overall I think I prefer the OnRez viewer to the Linden Lab&#8217;s one. Yesterday I had some problems with textures not rezzing, but now everything appears to be ok <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(they already had their first update yesterday)</span>. You do get CSI pop-ups each time you run the viewer and login, but they can easily be closed. <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> think I&#8217;ll stick with this viewer for now - mostly because of the browser.</span><br /><br />Now, moving on to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CSI part of the story</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(note: until now I&#8217;ve never seen an entire CSI episode - I usually switch after a few minutes)</span></span>. Yesterday I already picked up my CSI Toolbar <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(a HUD)</span> on one of the many CSI Orientation sims, walked through the orientation process, and solved my first crime. I must say the whole experience was quite pleasant and engaging. I think they made a good job of introducing the basics and they also prepared an interesting crime game. They also have nice <a href="http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/second_life/tutorials/">video tutorials</a> on the <a href="http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/second_life/">special Virtual CSI:NY site</a>. It makes one wonder how we could make some educational sims as interesting&#8230;<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1744653086/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 423px; height: 228px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2015/1744653086_0bde193aa4.jpg" alt="Investingating a crime scene with the CSI Toolbar" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Working on a crime scene with the CSI Toolbar</span></div>Anyway, I was also curious to see the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CSI TV episode</span> to see how they presented Second Life. I got the chance to see it this morning, and&#8230; hm&#8230; let me just say I&#8217;ve laughed out loud a few times. I don&#8217;t know which world they filmed this episode in, but it only looked like Second Life if you took screenshots of the scenes. There was absolutely no lag (!), everything <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(especially dressing up)</span> was done through a keyboard, no pie menus etc. Not to mention the silly gladiator game effects <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(<span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">there was a large audience at the event - certainly over 40 avatars - and no lag or crashing!)</span></span>, everybody using tools to fly, the silly comments made by most of the CSI team, and some sort of Second Life virus? Somebody&#8217;s been reading Snow Crash I presume or just playing another video game. Oh well, we&#8217;ve all seen how hacking is usually presented in movies. But anyhow, I&#8217;m not quite sure the picture of Second Life on the show would manage to get me interested enough in SL if I were a CSI viewer that&#8217;s never heard of Second Life. I mean, why would I want to go into a virtual world in which there&#8217;s a tech savvy professional killer or a world in which you can get a strange virus that keeps a whole team of IT experts busy for hours to fix? I certainly hope the commercials were better than that.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1744651938/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 330px; height: 275px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2378/1744651938_df342a4972.jpg" alt="CSI orientation crime scene" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Virtual crime and a game I like to call <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Guess who&#8217;s the sponsor of the project&#8221;</span><br /></span></div>Anyhow, quite many viewer of the show were apparently intrigued by the whole thing, and at this moment we still have many CSI newbies wandering around <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(btw we&#8217;ve also got improved versions of Clint &amp; Brandy - they come with skin, prim hair and decent clothing now ;) )</span>. A few moments ago I re-visited some of the orientation spots and I saw a lot of confused users. Not many very talking. Maybe they just didn&#8217;t realize they can use text chat - in the CSI episode they were using voice chat all the time; yeah I know, how realistic! Actually, just one newbie said hello and asked me &#8220;what are we suppose to do or where are we suppose to go?&#8221;. Hm, maybe not such a good orientation after all.

If you are like me, you probably have some of your <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> friends among your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> friends. And until recently, we had no good way of connecting the two worlds. But now we can; and there isn&#8217;t just one, but two Facebook applications that can help you with that.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601696109/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2367/1601696109_85a702b41b_o.png" alt="Facebook and Second Life" height="69" width="200" /></a></div><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><hr />Second Friends</span></span><br />The first app <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(by release order)</span> is called <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/secondfriends/">Second Friends</a> and was developed by <a href="http://artfossett.blogspot.com/2007/10/second-friends.html">Art Fossett</a> <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(I&#8217;m using the developer&#8217;s SL names in both cases)</span>. The app lets you display your avatar name and picture and a list of your Facebook friends that are using Second Friends on your Facebook profile. To use the app you need to do two things: you need to add the app on Facebook, and you need to pick up a personal key at an <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduserv%20Island/112/41/29">in-world kiosk on Eduserv island</a> (you can reset the app and get a new key anytime).<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601570625/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 380px; height: 202px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2369/1601570625_74a7f6aa96.jpg" alt="Second Friends in-world kiosk" /></a><br /><a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduserv%20Island/112/41/29">In-world kiosk on Eduserv island for Second Friends</a></div>You can then enter the key and your avatar name in the Second Friends form in Facebook. If you got that right, the app will import your Second Life profile picture into Facebook, and you are ready to display your SL name and avatar picture (if you wish so) on your profile.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601570075/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2387/1601570075_820051c668_m.jpg" alt="Second Friends on my Facebook profile" height="135" width="240" /></a></div>To add and check for Facebook friends that are using Second Friends, you have to go to the My Friends tab under the app, and a list of friends (including their RL and SL names) will be added to your profile. If you wish, you can also choose to display their SL profile pictures instead. The functionality of this app is pretty simple right now, but future plans include adding an in-world tool for updating your Second Friends status while in Second Life and more.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" >Second Life Link</span><br />The second app, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/second-life/">Second Life Link</a>, was developed by <a href="http://www.eslteacherlink.blogspot.com/">Fire Centaur</a> and another developer. It enables you to display your Facebook using SL friends in a similar way to the Facebook&#8217;s defalt friends&#8217; list.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1602461108/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2411/1602461108_8fb2e9a4cd_o.png" alt="Second Life Link on my Facebook profile" height="157" width="163" /></a></div>The setting up process is similar to the one you have to go through with Second Friends, although it has a few extra functions. You can start the process by either adding the app on Facebook or by touching the <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/English%20Village/158/181/144">in-world terminal in English Village</a>.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601571475/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 388px; height: 346px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2414/1601571475_84c18c914a.jpg" alt="Second Life Link terminal" /></a><br /><a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/English%20Village/158/181/144"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fire Centaur standing beside the Second Life Link terminal in English Village</span></a></div>In both cases you will get a personal key that you must enter either on Facebook or in-world <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(again, you can get another key anytime)</span>. A neat thing about Second Life Link is also the fact, that your Facebook friends get the option to register for a Second Life account on Facebook (in case they don&#8217;t already have one) after adding the app. So you can also send invites for the app to Facebook friends that don&#8217;t have a second life and trick them into getting one ;) After you&#8217;ve confirmed your identity, the app will automatically fill in your friends list with Facebook friends that are already using the app. Then you can also modify your Second Life Link profile by adding your avatar photo and one home and one favorite SL location you want to share with friends. Your SL friends will then be displayed on your profile with avatar photos and names, and if you click the See All link in the app on your profile or access the app from the left-hand menu, you can view whether your friends are online or offline in SL, and you can also teleport to their home or favorite location from Facebook.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601570781/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 417px; height: 150px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2098/1601570781_9293c7d5d2.jpg" alt="Second Life Link friends detail" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">That&#8217;s how my friends using Second Life Link can see me</span></div>Second Life Link also has advanced privacy settings, as you can see from the screenshot below, so you have full control of what your friends can see/do.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601570243/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 389px; height: 106px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2103/1601570243_f8fc4b623b.jpg" alt="Second Life Link privacy settings" /></a></div><hr /><br />Both apps are still in beta, and I&#8217;m sure both developers will welcome our feedback. Currently, I have both apps installed and appearing on my Facebook profile, because they both help me connect my Second and Facebook life in a bit different way. I&#8217;m certainly looking forward to new features of both apps; and who knows, maybe we&#8217;ll soon be able to &#8220;throw a sheep at&#8221; or &#8220;poke&#8221; our friends in SL from Facebook <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(throwing sheep should look spectacular in SL! ;) )</span>. But for now, I&#8217;m really excited about the fact that my SL friends can get a special place on my Facebook profile. So, if you&#8217;re a Facebook and Second Life user and want to connect the two, I recommend you give both apps a try, and let me <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(and of course the developers)</span> know what you like/don&#8217;t like, and what features would best for future versions :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/giving-your-facebook-profile-second.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/giving-your-facebook-profile-second.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
For me, one of the important questions I <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span> have to answer before creating any kind of content is: in which language will it be? Will it be in Slovenian (my mother tongue) or in English (the international language of the web that I&#8217;ve learned as a second language)? This was, of course, also a major question when I started this blog. And sometimes I really hate this question, and I hate having to choose between languages.<br /><br />On one hand, writing and speaking in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Slovenian</span> is always easier for me, but by choosing Slovenian as the language for my content, I automatically limit myself to an audience of probably no more than 2 million people <span style="color: #999999;">(and the number is even smaller if you consider the number of Slovenian speaking people that are actually interested in what I&#8217;m writing about)</span>. The fact that a lot of the current tech terms (and buzzwords) don&#8217;t yet have a good Slovenian translation, also make my decision more difficult because I sometimes feel like I&#8217;m writing half in English anyway.<br /><br />On the other hand, I get a much bigger potential audience by writing in <span style="font-weight: bold;">English</span>, but it makes writing/speaking a bit more difficult, and it may also make my content more difficult to understand <span style="color: #999999;">(or maybe even relate to?)</span> for Slovenian people that don&#8217;t speak English well or at all. And although I consider myself fluent in English, I often feel a bit insecure or self-conscious when I write or speak in English <span style="color: #999999;">(especially for an audience of native speakers)</span>. The self-consciousness is even more apparent in synchronous communication situations - like IM or more recently with Second Life voice. When I blog or write emails I have the time to reflect, analyze, run a spellchecker, so I feel more confident <span style="color: #999999;">(though I always worry about making typos that could be interpreted as insufficient knowledge)</span>.<br /><br />But no matter which language I choose, there is always the question: should I <span style="font-weight: bold;">translate</span> this to the other language? And sometimes I do translate, but usually I don&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t have the time or motivation to do it - and let&#8217;s not forget that some things are always lost in translation no matter how hard you try. There is just so much good content out there that&#8217;s impossible to translate it all back and forth to one language and another.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1516677570/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="Languages" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2185/1516677570_de1d9f8b37_o.png" style="height: 186px; width: 303px;" /></a></div>So how can one deal with the language problem? I often choose English over Slovenian just because it helps me to get in touch with so many wonderful people around the globe, but I sometimes miss more discussions in my own language. And that is why on some levels I&#8217;m glad I can now also blog for my <a href="http://www.artesia.si/">company&#8217;s website</a> in Slovenian, but then again: I often wish I could share some of my Slovenian content with my English speaking friends&#8230; I guess the language question can never have just one answer. For me, it&#8217;s always a bit of a struggle, and in the end it&#8217;s up to each individual to choose his/her &#8220;side&#8221;. It isn&#8217;t easy, but I guess it&#8217;s one of the prices you have to pay to live in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_is_Flat">flat world</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to finish this post by turning to you, dear reader, and asking for your answers to the language question. If you&#8217;re not a native English speaker, how do you choose the language you write/speak in? And if you&#8217;re a native English speaker, how do you deal with all the non-English content on the web? Do you ignore it or try to understand it by turning to native speakers of the foreign language or by trying to learn a foreign language? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on the subject :)<br /><br /><span style="color: #999999;">(And by the way: one of my Slovenian friends answered the language question when he recently <a href="http://lisica.wordpress.com/2007/09/24/let-it-courier/">started his blog</a>, so I guess I&#8217;m not alone in the language dilemma :) )</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/musings-on-importance-of-speaking.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/musings-on-importance-of-speaking.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Skitch offers different ways for getting images: you can take snapshots <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(it&#8217;s easy to capture just part of your screen)</span>, take a photo through your camera or work on any photo on your hard drive or on the web by dragging it into Skitch. Once you&#8217;ve got a photo in, you can add text and various shapes, and do a few basic edits. When you&#8217;re done, you can easily share it in any way you want. And what if you want to change the text or delete a shape later? No problem, you can always come back to the saved or uploaded images later and edit them again through Skitch <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(by the way - Skitch can also export images in the </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">svg</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> format; apart from the standard jpg, png, pdf and tif of course)</span>.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://myskitch.com/ialja/skitch_test-20071003-113531/"><img style="width: 312px; height: 236px;" src="http://myskitch.com/ialja/skitch_test-20071003-113531.png/preview.jpg" alt="Skitch test" /></a><br /><a style="font-family: Lucida Grande,Trebuchet,sans-serif,Helvetica,Arial; font-size: 10px; color: rgb(128, 128, 128);" href="http://plasq.com/skitch">Uploaded with Skitch!</a></div>I saw the promo video of Skitch some time ago, but then I really didn&#8217;t imagine how great it is to actually use it.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Recently, I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> talking to new users, and also talking to companies/institutions that want to get into Second Life. And one thing my colleagues and I have noticed is that some Second Life myths are still very popular among people. That is why I think that it&#8217;s important to talk about what Second Life is and what Second Life isn&#8217;t with a good dose of realism. So, here is our list of some of common myths that should in our opinion be addressed in any serious meeting/discussion about Second Life (and other virtual worlds):<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Life = Real Life.</span> Second Life is a just a virtual version of the real world with the same business models, customer needs and behavior. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WRONG</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1423633896/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 454px; height: 162px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1179/1423633896_3d942a7b40_o.png" alt="Second Life is not real life" /></a><br /></div>Many real world limitations don&#8217;t exist in Second Life. For this reason, the Second Life users have the freedom to behave differently than in the real world, satisfy different needs (for example, the need to have fantasy outfits) and literally take the world into their own hands.  Therefore it should come as no surprise that many established real world business and marketing models simply don&#8217;t work in SL. Real companies entering Second Life must get to know the virtual world and prove their value to the users.<br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Life = the world wide web. </span><br />Like on the web, users in Second Life will visit my island to get information about my company/institution. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WRONG</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1423634112/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 413px; height: 159px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1034/1423634112_5f75c6df9f_o.png" alt="Second Life is not the world wide web" /></a><br /></div>Second Life residents are not in SL to receive the same kind of content in 3D as they could on the web. They are there for new experiences, not links to web sites. There is nothing worse for Second Life users than clicking an advertisement and being moved out of Second Life into a new browser window. Established web privacy/value trade-offs (for example, letting a company know your e-mail in exchange for a discount) must be re-evaluated and set based on specific usage.<br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s easy to make money in Second Life. </span>Second Life will, in a short time, grow my company profits or allow me a comfortable side income.<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"> WRONG</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1422748331/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 356px; height: 160px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1173/1422748331_305b825735_o.png" alt="Second Life is not a money tree" /></a><br /></div>Yes, we do have money trees in Second Life, but don&#8217;t expect to get rich in SL with no effort. To make money, an individual or a company must be even more innovative and adaptable than in real world because of larger competition and a level playing field. Success requires time and effort. And don&#8217;t get in SL just with the vision of making money. Get in, enjoy the ride, and be inspired by what other are doing.<br /><br /><ul style="font-weight: bold;"><li>We know what works in Second Life and in what direction the future will take it. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">WRONG</span></li></ul> <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1423634708/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 129px; height: 161px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1121/1423634708_a73d5f6210_o.png" alt="The future of Second Life is not clear" /></a><br /></div>Nobody has a Second LIfe crystal ball, which can tell us SL best practices and future developments of virtual worlds. You can&#8217;t even guarantee that Second Life will work when you&#8217;ve got an important demo scheduled! It is important to remember that virtual worlds are still in early development stages - think of the state of the world wide web in 1995. Don&#8217;t trust people that claim they&#8217;ve got all the answers, and check the figures; Second Life doesn&#8217;t have 10 million unique users! And just as we&#8217;re all still finding our way around Second Life, nobody can predict for sure what virtual worlds will look like in 5 or even 10 years. Could anybody predict BitTorrent, Facebook, YouTube or Flickr in the Mosaic age?<br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s useful for me/my company/my institution to start getting acquainted with Second Life.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">RIGHT</span></li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1423635800/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 187px; height: 141px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1254/1423635800_01a0c1ed05_o.png" alt="Get a Second Life" /></a><br /></div>After the initial stages of experimentation, Second Life and virtual worlds will likely become a new way of communicating with colleagues, business partners, customers, friends and family and enable us a new way not only of doing business, but of living - just like mobile phones and the web have done in the past. Forward-looking companies/institutions and individuals that start learning about virtual worlds now will have an advantage in future. As I always say: there is no better way to understand a new technology than by trying it yourself. And I&#8217;d also suggest you to try different usages of Second Life. I might be spending a lot of time in Second Life for business/networking purposes, but I still find time for <a href="http://mindtracks.wordpress.com/2007/09/16/502/">fun explorations with friends</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to finish this post by adding some links to articles/resources that can also be useful when discussion Second Life and virtual worlds:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/internet/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201500141" target="_blank">Information Week: Five Rules For Bringing Your Real-Life Business Into Second Life</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.conference-board.org/utilities/pressDetail.cfm?press_ID=3205" target="_blank">Eight questions your company should ask when entering virtual worlds</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.fora.tv/searchresults.php?keywordsearch=Philip+Rosedale&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Second Life: What Do We Learn If We Digitize EVERYTHING?</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/mc/mpk20.html" target="_blank">MPK20: Sun&#8217;s virtual Workplace</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.slcn.tv/metanomics-ibm-metaverse" target="_blank">IBM in the Metaverse</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.slcn.tv/metanomics-metanomics-101" target="_blank">Metanomics</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.zenentrepreneur.com/blog/2007/08/pioneers-and-virtual-entrepreneurship.html" target="_blank">Virtual Entrepreneurship in Second Life: the New Pioneers</a></li></ul><br />And what are in your experience the most common myths and misconceptions you have to deal with when talking about Second Life?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/5-common-myths-about-second-life.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/5-common-myths-about-second-life.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Ru0JhrlBMSI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/4L1ztwnAmO0/s1600-h/moodle.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 104px; height: 78px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Ru0JhrlBMSI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/4L1ztwnAmO0/s320/moodle.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5110751626373706018" border="0" /></a>Lately I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time in <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle</a>; mainly of course as part of my <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_Teacher_Certificate">Moodle Teacher Certificate</a> (MTC) program <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(which </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://certificates.moodle.com/manage/view.php?code=LOOY-8GWQ-IIJ8-111T">I successfully completed</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> last week)</span>, but also because of the <a href="http://mk.campus02.at/">Austrian Moodle conference</a>, which I attended on Thursday and Friday in Graz <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I had a </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/sloodle">presentation</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> about the </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.sloodle.com/">Sloodle</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> project)</span>. I&#8217;ve been using Moodle in different roles (admin, tutor, user) for quite some years now, and I believe that Moodle is a great platform for e-learning because it&#8217;s powerful, relatively easy to use, and also expandable and customizable for different needs. What is also great is the fact that the Moodle developer community is very active and always making sure new versions have useful new features and improvements of previous standard modules.<br /><br />I had the pleasure to attend <a href="http://dougiamas.com/" alt="Creator of Moodle">Martin Dougiamas</a>&#8217; virtual presentation about the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roadmap">future of Moodle</a> at the Austrian Moodle conference a few days ago, and I&#8217;m really excited about some of the features we&#8217;ll be soon seeing in version 1.9, and also the roadmap for Moodle 2.0, which in my opinion has the potential of making Moodle 2.0 a great member of the Web 2.0 family. In this post I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my thoughts on the future of Moodle. I believe that Moodle has a <a href="http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/cs-moodle.xml">sustainable future</a>, so I&#8217;ll focus mainly on discussing upcoming Moodle features and possible future developments.<br /><br />Among Moodle 1.9 features that Martin presented on Thursday, I was most impressed by the added <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Student_projects/Social_Networking_features">social networking features</a>. I think it&#8217;s a great step towards making Moodle even more flexible and user friendly. If you&#8217;re a <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle.org</a> site user, make sure you edit your profile and add your interests and try finding users with common interests <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(check out the page for the tag &#8221;</span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://moodle.org/tag/index.php?id=1">moodle</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">&#8221; - cool, isn&#8217;t it?)</span>. Right now I sometimes feel limited by the rigid course structure in Moodle, and I really can&#8217;t wait to have a better way to connect with other Moodle users through tags and shared interests <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(similar to what </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://elgg.net/">Elgg</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> offers)</span>. And one of the next steps is hopefully the ability to mark Moodle items (forum posts, resources etc.) as favorites, so each user could create his/her own library of favorite resources.<br /><br />However, another problem I&#8217;ve been seeing with Moodle for some time now from the perspective of a common user (i.e. student role with no editing rights), was not just being closed in courses, but also being closed and limited to a certain Moodle site. I often found the thought that students lose access to their Moodle resources/activities/data after a course or study year is over disturbing. Of course, teachers have many options to export/import content and date, and move content/data among their courses and among Moodle sites. But the students don&#8217;t have any easy way to export their work and move it to a new Moodle site or to their personal archive somewhere else. So, I think one of the next steps in Moodle development should also be empowering users and enabling them to create their library of resources and also their Moodle portfolio that they (the students, not the teachers or administrators!) could take to another Moodle site (when changing schools for example). The Moodle development <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Roadmap">roadmap</a> shows plans of enabling easier connections between different Moodle sites through the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Moodle_Network">Moodle Network</a>, which plans to provide a Moodle <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Community_hub">Community Hub</a> for sharing content, user info, and enabling better peer interaction. However, I think that moving between Moodles should also be made easy for students, and not just for the teachers.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/images_en/c/ce/Community.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 444px; height: 208px;" src="http://docs.moodle.org/en/images_en/c/ce/Community.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><a style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Community_hub">Moodle Community Hub (from Moodle Docs)</a><br /></div>What I&#8217;d also like to see, is improvements in helping students getting around their Moodle courses. Moodle provides a block, which shows <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Recent_Activity">recent activity</a> since the last login for each course, and also an overview of your course through the <a href="http://docs.mjavascript/en/My_Moodle">My Moodle</a> page <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(though I really wonder how many administrators/teachers/students are aware of this option?)</span>. Still, I think the overview of my courses pages could and should be further improved by adding more flexibility and customization options. This could be very important for large Moodle sites with a lot of activity <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(like the moodle.org site, which I find very challenging to follow!)</span>. What I would like to see on the overview page is something closer to <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130">Facebook News feed page</a>. Students should be able to control what appears on this page, in what order, and in how much detail. Some sort of personal dashboard with more user-centric widgets. Now you can of course add some standard blocks to the overview page, but I miss more tools to help the users organize and plan their learning activities and perhaps an option to set up custom e-mail alerts that relate to specific course events. I really don&#8217;t like to receive e-mails for every Moodle post in a certain forum <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(especially for the most active ones)</span>, but I think it&#8217;d be useful to be able to add a rule to receive an e-mail update whenever a new resource/activity is posted (in any of courses you&#8217;re enrolled in) or when new topics that match your interests (keyword watcher) are started.<br /><br />All in all I&#8217;m really excited about Moodle adding more social networking features and establishing better connections between different Moodle installations and also the rest of the web. With all these improvements I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if in the future we could see Moodle also become a standardized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Learning_Environment">personal learning environment</a> with users in control of their learning data and the ability to move from one Moodle site to another <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(of course with the choice of moving only necessary portions of your Moodle profile data/library/portfolio)</span>? We&#8217;ll see what future Moodle development brings us. I certainly think Moodle is worth keeping an eye on, and I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on the upcoming Moodle versions :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/random-thoughts-about-future-of-moodle.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/09/random-thoughts-about-future-of-moodle.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
