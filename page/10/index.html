Just a brief announcement and invitation: I was invited to be the guest of the next ISTE Speaker Series Session in Second Life on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tuesday, February 19, 6 PM SLT</span>. I&#8217;ll be talking about my experience of being an online tutor and I hope you can join me for a great discussion. Here&#8217;s the official announcement from the <a href="http://secondlife.iste.wikispaces.net/events">ISTE Second Life wiki</a>:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Online Tutoring Across Different Platforms </span>with Alja Sulčič (SL: iAlja Writer)<br />Alja is a virtual platform expert in Slovenia working for Artesia, a small start-up focused on building virtual communities. Prior to joining Artesia she was an online tutor at the Faculty of Management Koper at University of Primorska for three years. She will be presenting about her experience as an online tutor in an online e-business course in which students were introduced to different internet technologies, from Moodle to Second Life, and about the challenges of working with emerging technologies in general. Alja is a member of the Second Life Volunteer Program, working mostly with new Slovenian Second Life users.</blockquote><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);" href="http://www.blogger.com/www.iste.org/secondlife/">ISTE</a> hosts great regular events, so you might want to check out their wiki for announcements for other events as well or check out <a href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/">Kevin Jarrett&#8217;s blog</a> for great posts about what&#8217;s going on at ISTE Second Life HQ. I must admit I haven&#8217;t yet managed to attend any of their events in person <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(6 PM SLT means 3 AM for me! :( )</span>, but I&#8217;ve heard great things about them.

I wish that me spending more time in the virtual world of <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> could be a good excuse for not blogging lately, but it really isn&#8217;t. Oh well, while I try to get into a blogging mood again, I&#8217;ve got a little something to share that will hopefully be useful to fellow SLers. I&#8217;d like to talk about Second Life group management today <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and no, it&#8217;s not another we-need-more-groups rant - </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://phasinggrace.blogspot.com/2008/01/25-group-symptom-in-second-life.html">Grace</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> already nailed that subject better than I ever could)</span>.<br /><br />Groups are a great way for two or more people to manage a parcel of land in SL for a common project, but when you need to have a larger group of users with different skills and roles, you might want to define more roles with different abilities in the group that owns your land. For example, you might not want to give less experienced users full control of objects on group owned land, but you might want to give them the ability to send out group notices.<br /><br />And something similar is just what I&#8217;ll soon have to do on a group owned land. As I need to carefully define the roles, I wanted to have a table outside SL with all possible abilities for roles listed. I was surprised not to find such a list, so I made one on my own. You can get the list in <a href="http://www.scribd.com/word/download/2036638?extension=xls">Excel</a> and <a href="http://www.scribd.com/word/download/2036637?extension=pdf">PDF</a> format on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a>.<br /><br /><div align="center"><object height="300" width="450"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="SameDomain"><param name="movie" value="http://static.scribd.com/FlashPaperS3.swf?guid=rfcv18dobbcc&amp;document_id=2036637&amp;page=1"><param name="scale" value="noScale"> <embed scale="noScale" src="http://static.scribd.com/FlashPaperS3.swf?guid=rfcv18dobbcc&amp;document_id=2036637&amp;page=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="300" width="450"></embed> </object></div><br />As there are three default roles <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Everyone</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">, </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Officer</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">, and </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Owner</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> in each SL group, I also marked which abilities each of the default role has. I also copied the comments for each of the ability. These comments are available in the Abilities tab under the Members &amp; Roles tab in the Group Information window and most of them include more details and the occasional useful warnings for group owners, so you might want to read them if you&#8217;re not sure what a role does. If you&#8217;re new to managing SL groups, you might also want to read the Knowledge Base articles about the <a href="https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4567">Group Roles</a> and about <a href="https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4041">Group Owned Land</a>. <a href="http://torley.com">Torley</a> also has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E0Y2xLd3gk">great tutorial</a> about creating groups and using the Group Information window for beginners.<br /><br />And I would love to hear how you go about defining SL group roles or any good advice/best practice you have about managing group roles and choosing abilities!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2008/02/list-of-abilities-and-roles-for-second.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2008/02/list-of-abilities-and-roles-for-second.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yes, I know it&#8217;s been awhile since my last blog post - but rest assured, I haven&#8217;t forgotten about my blog, it&#8217;s just that lately I&#8217;ve been dedicating more time to other social channels, especially <a href="http://twitter.com/iAlja">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=655122783">Facebook</a>, and of course also my <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. I really believe that you have to get immersed in any new technology in order to really understand it and be able to figure out why it works for so many people.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.facebook.com/"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 137px; height: 50px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R0latsTla-I/AAAAAAAAAKk/ispS-0UUrAE/s320/facebook+logo.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5136736591026678754" border="0" /></a>I already wrote about what I believe to be <a href="/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html">the magic behind Twitter</a>, and today I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my thoughts on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Facebook</span>. I decided to choose this subject not only because I find Facebook quite fascinating, but also because there are a lot of people out there wondering what FB is all about and what it should/can be used for. In fact, FB might seem pretty straightforward, but it can take some time to figure it out. And that is why I&#8217;ve decided to share my personal experience with FB.<br /><br />Ok, let&#8217;s just start with <span style="font-weight: bold;">the basics</span>. As you probably know, FB is a very popular social networking site, which enables you to create your profile and connect with friends. In addition to this, it has its own <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">developer platform</a>, which developers can use to build different applications that enable users to do more or less useful activities. Yes, these apps only work in the closed environment of FB, making the site almost some kind of web operating system that doesn&#8217;t want to talk to the rest of the web on its own, but requires developers to learn its language <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(called </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/FBML">FBML</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> to bring the magic of the web and social interactions to it. Not surprisingly, many people criticize FB for being a walled garden, and <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is now trying hard to out open social networks with <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial</a>; but for an average Joe all this is not very relevant. If you&#8217;ve got most of your friends on FB and a lot of fun things to do, you don&#8217;t really care how it&#8217;s done, so I&#8217;ll discuss the OpenSocial vs FB platform <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(or the new FB advertising options)</span> some other time. Today, I&#8217;d just like to focus on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">user perspective about various uses of FB apps</span>, which in my opinion are the magic ingredient that make FB so appealing to an increasing number of users <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(some might add: and such a time waster ;) )</span>.<br /><br />I think we can divide FB apps, and consequently FB&#8217;s value for the users, in <span style="font-weight: bold;">three main categories</span>:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >Self-promotion and branding</span>: At its core, FB is a place where you can build your own profile. When we build an online profile, we create our online <a href="http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2007/11/gartner-says-ge.html">persona</a>, which will be seen by our friends or even the entire world. We might not realize that, but when we fill in various profile fields or choose our profile picture, we decide how we want to be presented to the world. You might want to emphasize your professional side or your fun side; but in both cases we make a choice in how we &#8220;brand&#8221; ourselves to our public <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(which we can choose by limiting our profile only to contacts for example)</span>. And there are many FB functions and apps that can help us build our persona  <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(or even our personal brand)</span>, for example: various default profile options <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(picture, interests, work &amp; education info, favorite things,&#8230;)</span>, joining groups <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the FB groups function is awful, but I find it useful to publicly express my interest in certain topics)</span>, labeling yourself as a fan of something <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(made possible by the new product pages)</span>, your choice and variety of friends, the choice of profile layout <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(choosing which info to make public, having your <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/lastfmmusic/">music playlist</a>, favorite quotes or the result of a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/personaldna/">personality test</a> displayed, &#8230;)</span>, your FB statuses, the items that appear in our mini-feed etc.. Some people even prefer having multiple profiles for different personas <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(for example, a different account for their Second Life avatar)</span>. Building our FB persona can be quite a task, and a lot of people choose to use just this aspect of FB. They register, fill in the info and connect with friends, and use FB just to say &#8220;I&#8217;m online too - if you want to connect to me use my e-mail/phone number&#8221;. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >Social play</span>: The next category of FB apps enables us to have fun and keep in touch with out friends. We all have busy lives, a lot of our friends live in different cities or even parts of the world, and it&#8217;s often not easy to find the time or way to hang out together. And here is where FB can help: it enables us to keep in touch with friend through different social <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(often playful)</span> activities. Even if you&#8217;re extremely busy, you can always find a minute or two to poke your friends, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/superpokey/">throw a sheep at them</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/zombies/">turn them into a zombie</a> or send them a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/growing/">virtual pet</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/growing/">flower</a> or <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/freegifts/">image</a>. All these apps help us say &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about you&#8221; in different ways. It might look silly, but it feels nice to receive virtual cakes when you set your status to ill. We often like to say &#8220;It&#8217;s the thought that counts&#8221;, and I think the social play apps in FB are a great proof of that. Also, the FB news feed, which displays various news about our friends, can help us feel closer to each other as it&#8217;s constantly reminding of people, telling us what they are doing and providing an easy way to interact with them <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(&#8220;Click here to hug your friend too&#8221;)</span>. Sure, the feed items are a great way for developers to promote their app, but it does have some positive side effects I&#8217;ve just mentioned.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >(Social) toolbox</span>: The last category of apps is represented by a set of utilities that can help you save time, provide useful information and even be more organized. These apps can make FB a more &#8220;serious&#8221; tool. They enable us things like <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fmailclient/">checking our e-mail</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/myoffices/">collaborating on documents</a> with friends, getting info about <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/myoffices/">weather</a>, keeping track of <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/timezones/">what time it is for our friends that live in different time zones</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my latest favorite app!)<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, displaying <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/blogfriends/">latest blog entries</a> from your friends and yourself</span></span> and much more. These apps are the main reason why people are considering using FB as a business tool or even an <a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/08/08-07-06tdc/08-07-06dnews-02.asp">e-learning tool</a>. It&#8217;s comfortable to be able to do so many different things <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(from play to work)</span> on one single site, and if we want so, we can even make our &#8220;serious&#8221; activities social by choosing to display info from utility apps on our profile, and thus provide some valuable info to our contacts <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I like to use </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.facebook.com/posted.php">FB Posted Items</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> for this purpose)</span>.</li></ul>These categories can of course often be overlapping - for example, social play apps or social toolbox apps can be used as a branding tool, and often the line between social play and social toolbox can be a fine one. An important point to remember here is that <span style="font-weight: bold;">you don&#8217;t need to use every aspect of Facebook; use what makes sense to you</span>. It&#8217;s fine if you just want to create a basic profile, and it&#8217; fine if you just want to use FB as a social toolbox and ignore the play aspects.<br /><br /><hr /><br />I&#8217;d like to conclude this post with some <span style="font-weight: bold;">basic Facebook tips</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"></span> that I hope can help you in the process of getting to know FB and finding the added value of this tool for you:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play with FB, but make sure you&#8217;ve got friends to play with.</span> Try out different apps, explore, and be curious, but try not to annoy your friends while doing that. You don&#8217;t have to send out invites to ALL of your friends for EVERY app you add (there&#8217;s always a Skip button!). Show your friends you care and know them by sending them invitations for apps that you are pretty sure will be interesting for them.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take some time to adjust your privacy settings.</span> Decide which info/activities can be public, for friends or entirely private. You can also decide whether you want your name to appear in search or not. In the future we&#8217;ll have the abilities to group friends and have different profiles for close friends, professional contacts, family etc.; but until we don&#8217;t, try to figure out the best way to present yourself to all the people on your contacts list. You might want consider using the limited profile contacts you don&#8217;t know well. You can find all these settings under the Privacy link in the upper right corner.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remember that you don&#8217;t need to have every app you use on your profile.</span> You can access apps from the left-hand menu or the application list. Removing an app box from your profile only will not delete the app, and you will still be able to receive gifts, bite chumps and do all the other *fun* activities. Your friends can often see your app info <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(for example: </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://apps.facebook.com/likeness/">Linkeness score</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> from the app itself, so there&#8217;s really no need to keep everything on your profile. I know it&#8217;s not easy, but try not to overload your profile page. When I choose what I want on my profile or not, I like to think about what info I can provide to a new friend that want to get to know me better, and what info I can provide to friends that I haven&#8217;t spoken in a while. So, to put it simply, take care of your persona, and remember that you can choose the visibility for each profile element. Some info are for friends only while you might want to have some available public.</li></ul>But of course, this post is based entirely of my Facebook experience in the past few months, and I&#8217;m sure we all have our own story to tell. So I&#8217;m really interested in hearing <span style="font-weight: bold;">your Facebook story</span>: how and why are you using FB, and what is in your opinion the added value of FB over other social networks? Also, what do you think are the best tips you could give to people just starting with FB or people still trying to figure out what the fuss is about?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/11/facebook-what-why-how.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/11/facebook-what-why-how.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday we were finally able to get our hands on the <a href="http://viewer.onrez.com/">new OnRez viewer</a> for <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> that was made for a special episode of the hit show <a href="http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/">CSI New York</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(which was also aired last night)</span>. The viewer is available both for Windows and Mac OS X and it&#8217;s got a simplified user interface and a built-it browser. If you&#8217;re familiar with the existing Linden Lab&#8217;s viewer you&#8217;ll need some time to get adjusted to some changes. The most obvious one is the fact that you now have the Friends button in the lower right corner instead of the Inventory button - I suppose they think users will need their friends&#8217; list more often then their inventory, which can now be found under a button at the top of the screen and it&#8217;s been renamed to &#8220;My Stuff&#8221; <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I don&#8217;t even want to comment on that)</span>. The good news is that most of the shortcuts still work, and you still have the client menu and all the advanced options <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(you need to manually enable the Build menu and the advanced options under the View menu)</span>.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1744653694/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 440px; height: 249px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2175/1744653694_e2e41f53bb.jpg" alt="OnRez user interface" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Some of the new UI elements (the HUD is detachable)</span></div>And even better news is that we now finally have the <span style="font-weight: bold;">back button</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and teleport history)</span> built-in. The home button in the upper menu bar is a bit confusing for me though - it takes me to Central park on the CIS sims, although the usual shortcut for home still takes me to my real home. But the best feature of all <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(at least for me)</span> is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">built-in browser</span>. Sure, it&#8217;s pretty basic <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(no Flash for example)</span>, but it works, it&#8217;s fast, easily accessible and it seems like a better way for displaying text help files than through notecards, as web pages can of course be hyperlinked and enriched with various design elements.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1743805103/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 428px; height: 241px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2320/1743805103_0726366cee.jpg" alt="My blog in the OnRez viewer" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Viewing my blog in the OnRez viewer</span></div>Overall I think I prefer the OnRez viewer to the Linden Lab&#8217;s one. Yesterday I had some problems with textures not rezzing, but now everything appears to be ok <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(they already had their first update yesterday)</span>. You do get CSI pop-ups each time you run the viewer and login, but they can easily be closed. <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> think I&#8217;ll stick with this viewer for now - mostly because of the browser.</span><br /><br />Now, moving on to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CSI part of the story</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(note: until now I&#8217;ve never seen an entire CSI episode - I usually switch after a few minutes)</span></span>. Yesterday I already picked up my CSI Toolbar <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(a HUD)</span> on one of the many CSI Orientation sims, walked through the orientation process, and solved my first crime. I must say the whole experience was quite pleasant and engaging. I think they made a good job of introducing the basics and they also prepared an interesting crime game. They also have nice <a href="http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/second_life/tutorials/">video tutorials</a> on the <a href="http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/second_life/">special Virtual CSI:NY site</a>. It makes one wonder how we could make some educational sims as interesting&#8230;<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1744653086/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 423px; height: 228px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2015/1744653086_0bde193aa4.jpg" alt="Investingating a crime scene with the CSI Toolbar" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Working on a crime scene with the CSI Toolbar</span></div>Anyway, I was also curious to see the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CSI TV episode</span> to see how they presented Second Life. I got the chance to see it this morning, and&#8230; hm&#8230; let me just say I&#8217;ve laughed out loud a few times. I don&#8217;t know which world they filmed this episode in, but it only looked like Second Life if you took screenshots of the scenes. There was absolutely no lag (!), everything <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(especially dressing up)</span> was done through a keyboard, no pie menus etc. Not to mention the silly gladiator game effects <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(<span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">there was a large audience at the event - certainly over 40 avatars - and no lag or crashing!)</span></span>, everybody using tools to fly, the silly comments made by most of the CSI team, and some sort of Second Life virus? Somebody&#8217;s been reading Snow Crash I presume or just playing another video game. Oh well, we&#8217;ve all seen how hacking is usually presented in movies. But anyhow, I&#8217;m not quite sure the picture of Second Life on the show would manage to get me interested enough in SL if I were a CSI viewer that&#8217;s never heard of Second Life. I mean, why would I want to go into a virtual world in which there&#8217;s a tech savvy professional killer or a world in which you can get a strange virus that keeps a whole team of IT experts busy for hours to fix? I certainly hope the commercials were better than that.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1744651938/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 330px; height: 275px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2378/1744651938_df342a4972.jpg" alt="CSI orientation crime scene" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Virtual crime and a game I like to call <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Guess who&#8217;s the sponsor of the project&#8221;</span><br /></span></div>Anyhow, quite many viewer of the show were apparently intrigued by the whole thing, and at this moment we still have many CSI newbies wandering around <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(btw we&#8217;ve also got improved versions of Clint &amp; Brandy - they come with skin, prim hair and decent clothing now ;) )</span>. A few moments ago I re-visited some of the orientation spots and I saw a lot of confused users. Not many very talking. Maybe they just didn&#8217;t realize they can use text chat - in the CSI episode they were using voice chat all the time; yeah I know, how realistic! Actually, just one newbie said hello and asked me &#8220;what are we suppose to do or where are we suppose to go?&#8221;. Hm, maybe not such a good orientation after all. Maybe we should have more greeters at the starting points <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I did meet one last night)</span>.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RyB6H8ieHZI/AAAAAAAAAJg/00WeS_lLjZ0/s1600-h/CSI+Brandy.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RyB6H8ieHZI/AAAAAAAAAJg/00WeS_lLjZ0/s320/CSI+Brandy.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5125230652876004754" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Meet the new Brandy - this defaults certainly look better than usually</span><br /></div>I think it&#8217;s still way too soon to make any final judgments on the successfulness of the whole CSI in SL thing. I&#8217;m personally glad I got a nice new viewer, but we still have to see if and how the CSI viewers will play along in this game. The Second Life grid survived last night <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the load wasn&#8217;t even that big)</span>, but let&#8217;s wait for a few days to get more numbers and to see how many of the new users will stay in SL after they learn how the world really works.<br /><br />Oh an by the way - today we have another big Second Life TV appearance on the <a href="http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2007/10/the-office-does.html">series The Office</a>. Oh dear. Not sure whether I should be excited or scared about that :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/onrez-second-life-viewer-csi-ny-in-sl.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/onrez-second-life-viewer-csi-ny-in-sl.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

If you are like me, you probably have some of your <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> friends among your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> friends. And until recently, we had no good way of connecting the two worlds. But now we can; and there isn&#8217;t just one, but two Facebook applications that can help you with that.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601696109/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2367/1601696109_85a702b41b_o.png" alt="Facebook and Second Life" height="69" width="200" /></a></div><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><hr />Second Friends</span></span><br />The first app <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(by release order)</span> is called <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/secondfriends/">Second Friends</a> and was developed by <a href="http://artfossett.blogspot.com/2007/10/second-friends.html">Art Fossett</a> <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(I&#8217;m using the developer&#8217;s SL names in both cases)</span>. The app lets you display your avatar name and picture and a list of your Facebook friends that are using Second Friends on your Facebook profile. To use the app you need to do two things: you need to add the app on Facebook, and you need to pick up a personal key at an <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduserv%20Island/112/41/29">in-world kiosk on Eduserv island</a> (you can reset the app and get a new key anytime).<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601570625/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 380px; height: 202px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2369/1601570625_74a7f6aa96.jpg" alt="Second Friends in-world kiosk" /></a><br /><a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduserv%20Island/112/41/29">In-world kiosk on Eduserv island for Second Friends</a></div>You can then enter the key and your avatar name in the Second Friends form in Facebook. If you got that right, the app will import your Second Life profile picture into Facebook, and you are ready to display your SL name and avatar picture (if you wish so) on your profile.<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601570075/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2387/1601570075_820051c668_m.jpg" alt="Second Friends on my Facebook profile" height="135" width="240" /></a></div>To add and check for Facebook friends that are using Second Friends, you have to go to the My Friends tab under the app, and a list of friends (including their RL and SL names) will be added to your profile. If you wish, you can also choose to display their SL profile pictures instead. The functionality of this app is pretty simple right now, but future plans include adding an in-world tool for updating your Second Friends status while in Second Life and more.<br /><br /><hr /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" >Second Life Link</span><br />The second app, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/second-life/">Second Life Link</a>, was developed by <a href="http://www.eslteacherlink.blogspot.com/">Fire Centaur</a> and another developer. It enables you to display your Facebook using SL friends in a similar way to the Facebook&#8217;s defalt friends&#8217; list.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1602461108/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2411/1602461108_8fb2e9a4cd_o.png" alt="Second Life Link on my Facebook profile" height="157" width="163" /></a></div>The setting up process is similar to the one you have to go through with Second Friends, although it has a few extra functions. You can start the process by either adding the app on Facebook or by touching the <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/English%20Village/158/181/144">in-world terminal in English Village</a>.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601571475/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 388px; height: 346px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2414/1601571475_84c18c914a.jpg" alt="Second Life Link terminal" /></a><br /><a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/English%20Village/158/181/144"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fire Centaur standing beside the Second Life Link terminal in English Village</span></a></div>In both cases you will get a personal key that you must enter either on Facebook or in-world <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(again, you can get another key anytime)</span>. A neat thing about Second Life Link is also the fact, that your Facebook friends get the option to register for a Second Life account on Facebook (in case they don&#8217;t already have one) after adding the app. So you can also send invites for the app to Facebook friends that don&#8217;t have a second life and trick them into getting one ;) After you&#8217;ve confirmed your identity, the app will automatically fill in your friends list with Facebook friends that are already using the app. Then you can also modify your Second Life Link profile by adding your avatar photo and one home and one favorite SL location you want to share with friends. Your SL friends will then be displayed on your profile with avatar photos and names, and if you click the See All link in the app on your profile or access the app from the left-hand menu, you can view whether your friends are online or offline in SL, and you can also teleport to their home or favorite location from Facebook.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601570781/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 417px; height: 150px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2098/1601570781_9293c7d5d2.jpg" alt="Second Life Link friends detail" /></a><br /><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">That&#8217;s how my friends using Second Life Link can see me</span></div>Second Life Link also has advanced privacy settings, as you can see from the screenshot below, so you have full control of what your friends can see/do.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/1601570243/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 389px; height: 106px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2103/1601570243_f8fc4b623b.jpg" alt="Second Life Link privacy settings" /></a></div><hr /><br />Both apps are still in beta, and I&#8217;m sure both developers will welcome our feedback. Currently, I have both apps installed and appearing on my Facebook profile, because they both help me connect my Second and Facebook life in a bit different way. I&#8217;m certainly looking forward to new features of both apps; and who knows, maybe we&#8217;ll soon be able to &#8220;throw a sheep at&#8221; or &#8220;poke&#8221; our friends in SL from Facebook <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(throwing sheep should look spectacular in SL! ;) )</span>. But for now, I&#8217;m really excited about the fact that my SL friends can get a special place on my Facebook profile. So, if you&#8217;re a Facebook and Second Life user and want to connect the two, I recommend you give both apps a try, and let me <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(and of course the developers)</span> know what you like/don&#8217;t like, and what features would best for future versions :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/giving-your-facebook-profile-second.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/10/giving-your-facebook-profile-second.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
