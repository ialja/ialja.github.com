After a lovely Greek vacation <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I highly recommed Greece for vacation - great food, great people, crystal clear sea!)</span> I had one of the busiest week (and weekend) ever: all the catching up with RSS feeds, mails + intensive work on two different projects&#8230; and the result of that is that I still haven&#8217;t managed to reply to all mails <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(bad Alja, bad!)</span>, and I&#8217;m also late for my blogger homework, which was assigned to me by <a href="http://www.bretagdesigns.com/technologist/?p=334">The Four Eyed Technologist</a> 12 days ago <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(so says </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.technorati.com/blogs/ialja.blogspot.com?reactions">Technorati</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> :) )</span>. So, it&#8217;s now time to stop making excuses and join the &#8220;8 Random Things&#8221; game that has been spreading around the blogosphere for quite some time now. I admit that I&#8217;ve been reading many random things about many of you in the past weeks with quite some interest, so it&#8217;s only fair to do my share now :)<br /><br />First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">The rules:</span><br /><ol><li>Post these rules before you give your facts.</li><li>List 8 random facts about yourself.</li><li>At the end of your post, choose (tag) 8 people and list their names, linking to them.</li><li>Leave a comment on their blog, letting them know they’ve been tagged.</li></ol><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">My 8 Random Things:</span><br /><ol><li>I trained track and field athletics for about 10 years in different disciplines; I started in first grade in long distances, and ended up doing long jump and 60m/100m hurdles. I wasn&#8217;t too bad at it <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(even got into the national team once)</span>, but I quit because I lost my interest in competitions.</li><li>At the end of elementary school I wanted to study chemistry, but then lost all interest for it in high school and turned towards computer and social sciences.<br /></li><li>I love animation movies and cartoons in general. On my top list are Pixar movies <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(</span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.pixar.com/shorts/ftb/index.html">this short one</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> is imho enough to explain the brilliance of Pixar)</span> and Japanese sci-fi animes, but I like to watch just any animated thing that pops on screen.</li><li>I don&#8217;t like travelling much, especially by car. I keep hoping teleport systems will be invented in my lifetime :)</li><li>My interested for education highly derives from the fact that I was bored at school 90 % of the time, and I spent most of that time drawing various sketches in my notebooks.</li><li>I am shortsighted - couldn&#8217;t get far through the day without glasses or contact lenses! Part of it is inherited, and part of it is the price of being a computer geek and living behind computer screens.</li><li>I love the sea; now that I don&#8217;t live by the sea anymore, I really miss the sea air, and the wind you only get on the coast&#8230; And thinking of that always reminds me of the song &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gente_Di_Mare">Gente di mare</a>&#8221;.</li><li>I had compulsory Italian classes for 12 years in school as I lived in a bilingual zone (near the Slovenian-Italian border). And now I haven&#8217;t really spoken it for 5 years! I still understand it very well, but I don&#8217;t dare to speak or write it anymore - and that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to change.</li></ol>So, I hope you found my 8 random things interesting :) Now, I should tag 8 more people, but I feel like so many of you already played this game or been tagged, and I also don&#8217;t want to <span style="font-style: italic;">make</span> anyone play this game, sooo I will follow <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/2007/08/10/ive-been-double-tagged/">Angela</a>&#8217;s example <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/?p=364">KJ</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">&#8217;s ;) )</span> and invite you readers of this blog, who want to be tagged and share with us 8 random things <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I assure you: it is quite fun and painless! :) )</span> to leave a comment on this post and I&#8217;ll add you to the list, ok? :)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">List of great bloggers</span> that will be happy to share 8 random things:<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daniel</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(not a blogger (yet! ;) ), but he shared some interesting things in his comment)</span><br /></li><li><a href="http://cpappasonline.blogspot.com/">Christopher</a><br /></li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li><li style="font-style: italic;">position open</li></ol><br /><a href="http://eduspaces.net/davidds/weblog/"></a><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/catching-up-8-random-things-about-me.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/catching-up-8-random-things-about-me.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Ok, yes, I admit: <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">I finally joined the Twitter fever</a>, and I am in fact enjoying it. All for higher research purposes only, of course. Ahem. Anyway, in this post I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my first findings/impressions about being a <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(still newbie! :) )</span> Twit.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBk0e-eHoI/AAAAAAAAAGE/69Jw2s13a2k/s1600-h/twitter.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 155px; height: 36px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBk0e-eHoI/AAAAAAAAAGE/69Jw2s13a2k/s320/twitter.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093682031387090562" border="0" /></a>So, as you probably know by now, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is a simple web sites that keeps asking you and everyone else one simple question: <span style="font-weight: bold;">What are you doing?</span> And yes, people from all over the world answer this same question (in 140 characters or less) several times a day, and read answers their friends, acquaintances, or strangers <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(it&#8217;s the Internet after all!)</span> provide. <a href="http://edtechatouille.blogspot.com/2007/07/twitter-uniqueness-ambi-synchronous.html">Many are wondering</a> at <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/what-the-tweet/">what makes people Tweet</a>, but as with most Web 2.0 phenomena you can&#8217;t really know/understand what it is all about until you give it a try <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and I mean really give it a try by <span style="font-weight: bold;">actively participating</span>!)</span>.<br /><br />Here are some of my ideas of why Twitter works. Actually, answering the question <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</span> on the web is not a new idea. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s been around for years in different communities</span>; I think that most (if not all) of the forums I used to participate in had an always popular topic <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;What are we doing right now&#8221;</span>, in which members would post short (one sentence) answers. These topics were always a great way to kill time, but also to build a special connection between forum members and strengthen the forum community. In these topics you were could read small little details about members&#8217; lives - their passions, dreams, joys, frustrations and what not - and you got the feeling that you knew them a little better.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.whywerock.com/wp-content/images/2007/01/twitterrific_logo.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 108px; height: 108px;" src="http://www.whywerock.com/wp-content/images/2007/01/twitterrific_logo.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>But of course, these &#8220;Tweet topics&#8221; were constrained to a certain web place - the forum - and people get restless if they are limited to one, same old, same old place. Especially because you can&#8217;t ever find <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of your friends and other interesting people in just one place! And I think that&#8217;s where the folks at Twitter got a brilliant idea and offered the users the power to <span style="font-weight: bold;">connect socially across different places</span>. Sure, you still have to get a Twitter account, but once you get that, you can Tweet from anywhere you like - <a href="http://twitter.com/">the Twitter web site</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/blog/2007/05/theres-twitter-in-my-facebook.html">other websites</a>, your <a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=28">IM client</a>, your <a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">browser</a>, your <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/email_messaging/twidgettwitterdashboardwidget.html">dashboard</a>, your <a href="http://ordinalmalaprop.com/twitter/">Second</a> <a href="http://www.squawknest.com/about">Life</a>, your <a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=14">mobile phone</a>,&#8230; and you can also read Tweets from your friends from any place you like! You are no longer limited to one application, one website - and I think we&#8217;ll be seeing more of that in the future of the Internet. For this reason<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Twitter is the ultimate social network - anywhere, anytime.</span> Saying &#8220;I have to go out&#8221; is usually the end of an IM conversation, but can be a start to a Twitter one! Once you set it Twitter up and find your friends, you just enjoy the ride and get connected with your social network - and along the way you can of course discover interesting Tweets from your friends&#8217; friends and expand your social network.<br /><br />Speaking of differences between Twitter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">IM</a>: people often ask why is Twitter different/better than IM? I think Twitter has some advantages over using IM. Firstly, it is not as time demanding, because you usually aren&#8217;t expected to reply immediately (although you easily can if you want to), and it takes away less time than having 10 separate IM conversations. But still - you are up-to-date with what your friends are doing, and can provide feedback if needed. And although Twitter can also be <a href="http://www.crucialthought.com/2007/07/24/twitterfox-dangerous-for-your-cognitive-health/">disruptive</a>, I think it is very easy to turn off notifications when you need to concentrate on doing something - and <span style="font-style: italic;">nobody actually knows you aren&#8217;t receiving notifications</span> (unlike with IM when your contacts know when you&#8217;re offline).  One of my Twitter friends <a href="http://twitter.com/anyaixchel">anyaixchel</a> found a perfect word to describe the communication process on Twitter: <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/2007/07/31/the-writing-and-communication-process-in-facebook-and-twitter/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ambi-synchronous</span></a>. I find Twitter communication really fascinating. It is very simple, but yet it connects people in an almost magic way. And again - I think its main advantage is that it is not limited to one single place, but is in a way <span style="font-weight: bold;">universally accessible</span> no matter where you are.<br /><br />And because of that characteristic I believe that Twitter can be used in many different ways: as a travel journal <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the expenses of sending an SMS on the road are often much lower than trying to find a computer with internet access in some places)</span>, as a flash news feed <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(see </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://twitter.com/reuters">example</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span>, as an <a href="http://twittercal.com/">event reminder</a>, as a tool for class notifications <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I wish we had Twitter when I was in school!)</span>, and many more. The Twitter mania is just starting, so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll all be able to find many other innovative usages of this new tool.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBkFe-eHmI/AAAAAAAAAF0/JXU1g3Xm5lI/s1600-h/twitter+ialja.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 238px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBkFe-eHmI/AAAAAAAAAF0/JXU1g3Xm5lI/s320/twitter+ialja.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093681223933238882" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">My Twitter starting (but not the only!) point</span><br /></div>Until then you are of course all invited to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">me</a> (or anybody else ;) ) on Twitter, and maybe we can come up with some new ideas together while Tweeting about less or more important events and thoughts of our lives :)<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">By the way: Twitter is not the only bird on the block. One interesting (and great looking!) variation of Twitter is for instance <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku,</a> which is also great for aggregating different feeds you might have (blog, Flickr, del.icio.us etc). Have a look at <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">my Jaikus</a> for an example. Unfortunately Jaiku doesn&#8217;t (yet) support IM notifications, and so it is not as place independent as Twitter. </span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
In the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been curiously exploring <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">Twitter</a>, and even <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(more about those in future posts)</span>; and that is mostly why I haven&#8217;t been posting to my blog as much as I would like to. Another thing I&#8217;ve been doing is trying out different virtual worlds (<a href="http://www.there.com/">There</a>, <a href="http://www.kaneva.com/">Kaneva</a>, <a href="http://www.multiverse.net/">Multiverse</a>, &#8230;). I was curious to see if Second Life is really the best in social virtual worlds we currently got. And I must say I now appreciate my Second Life more :)<br /><br />The reason behind my &#8220;virtual worlds exploration&#8221; is that I will probably have to do some introductory presentations about virtual worlds (and in particular Second Life) in the next few months, and that is also why I spent the past week making a &#8220;master presentation&#8221; on the subject. My goal was to create a presentation with a brief explanation of what virtual worlds are, of what is Second Life, and of different things we can do with Second Life. And here is the result:<br /><div align="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=83940&doc=virtual-worlds-introduction-second-life-and-beyond4228" height="348" width="425"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=83940&amp;doc=virtual-worlds-introduction-second-life-and-beyond4228"></object></div>I think this presentation can be used for different audiences by taking out some slides, so I hope you will also find it useful for some of your presentations. As it is meant as an introductory presentation, I didn&#8217;t focus on details, but rather on presenting the key facts and some of the most attractive aspects of virtual worlds and Second Life. I posted the presentation on SlideShare along with comments for each slides with links to sources I used, so I suggest you take a look at those comments as well. And of course: your comments/suggestions regarding this presentation are welcome either on SlideShare or on this post :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/presentation-second-life-and-beyond.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/presentation-second-life-and-beyond.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Just a short notice: I&#8217;m taking this week off for a short vacation at the sea. I&#8217;ll have internet access, but I&#8217;ll try to avoid it if possible (my wrists really need some rest), thought I&#8217;ll probably post little updates on <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>. I already have some great books packed, and I really can&#8217;t wait to relax on the beach and enjoy the sea air. I&#8217;ll be back in the digital world next week, so stay tuned! :)<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/758876237/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 347px; height: 262px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1140/758876237_a0ff22aa79.jpg" alt="Sunset in Koper" /></a></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/taking-week-off.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/taking-week-off.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Yesterday I had one of the most magical days in my <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> thanks to some really great people and a bit of magic coincidence. I haven&#8217;t had much of Second Life lately due to different first life obligations, so yesterday I had a great chance to do some catching up, and I was really reminded of why I still believe in the potentials of Second Life. Mostly, I was once again reminded of the unique way in which Second Life is able to bring people from all over together.<br /><br />First, I meet up again with <a href="http://profiles.slbuzz.com/eyebeams-electricteeth">Eyebeams Electricteeth</a> (of <a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/?page_id=71">Learn 4 Life</a>), who has great ambitions and plans to make SL more popular among UK educators (and also abroad) and is working on some interesting projects in SL <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(you&#8217;ll probably hear more about that in the next months)</span>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he had some other things to do, so I moved on and asked to meet <a href="http://bethssecondlife.blogspot.com/">Desi</a> somewhere, as we haven&#8217;t seen each other in ages <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my fault)</span>. After mentioning that I still don&#8217;t have any place in SL, Desi kindly offered to let me use some space in their new <a href="http://collegeenglish.wikispaces.com/LiteratureAlive">Literature Alive! HQ</a> on Eduisland II. So, we went to check out the place (2nd floor), Desi brought in a couch <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(with one really funny sitting pose ;) )</span>, and we started talking. She also invited <a href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/">KJ Hax</a> over, who invited <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/">Any Ixchel</a>, and what happened was real <a href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/?p=276">serendipity</a>. Later on we were also joined by Corwin Carillon, Eloise Pasteur, and Butch Dee, and we had a really inspiring discussion. We talked about Second Life in general, avatars, identity, and we also shared some useful SL tools <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(thanks for the tip about the</span> <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Blumfield/26/151/47">MystiTool HUD</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">! It&#8217;s just amazing!)</span></span>. It was a real pleasure meeting you all!<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rot8VqcjzWI/AAAAAAAAAFs/wajhIhOTbF4/s1600-h/serendipity.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Rot8VqcjzWI/AAAAAAAAAFs/wajhIhOTbF4/s320/serendipity.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5083293316030909794" border="0" /></a><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kjarrett/704522850/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Me, Desi, KJ, and Anya</span></a><br /></div></div>After the discussion Anya, Desi, and I went to do a bit of gadget shopping. Soon  Anya&#8217;s friend <a href="http://www.lostbiro.com/blog/">Aiji Ducatillon</a> joined us, and we went to Anya&#8217;s place to do some hang gliding, and playing with toys <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(Aiji thanks for the ride and the massage; Anya thanks for the giraffes and the cats! :) )</span>. It was a lot of fun, and I surely hope we can do this again sometime <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I&#8217;m glad I now have some friends from down under I can hang out with in EU friendly times :) )</span>.<br /><br />I spent rest of the day in my new &#8220;office&#8221; space Desi has kindly offered to me. I brought in a big and comfy couch, a cookie and coffee giving table <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(just touch it :) )</span>, and an info point that can tell you whether I&#8217;m online or offline and will open my blog when touched. I hope you&#8217;ll all come to visit me sometime (<a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduisland%20II/196/219/47">http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduisland%20II/196/219/47</a>), and that we&#8217;ll be able to have more serendipitous moments in that space. Feel free to use the couch any time, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">don&#8217;t forget to invite your friends over</span>! :)<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/713534279/"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 462px; height: 253px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1332/713534279_6c5a57c270.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: bold;">Come over any time</span><br /></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-wonderful-second-life.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-wonderful-second-life.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
