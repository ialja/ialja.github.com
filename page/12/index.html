Ok, yes, I admit: <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">I finally joined the Twitter fever</a>, and I am in fact enjoying it. All for higher research purposes only, of course. Ahem. Anyway, in this post I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my first findings/impressions about being a <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(still newbie! :) )</span> Twit.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBk0e-eHoI/AAAAAAAAAGE/69Jw2s13a2k/s1600-h/twitter.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 155px; height: 36px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBk0e-eHoI/AAAAAAAAAGE/69Jw2s13a2k/s320/twitter.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093682031387090562" border="0" /></a>So, as you probably know by now, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is a simple web sites that keeps asking you and everyone else one simple question: <span style="font-weight: bold;">What are you doing?</span> And yes, people from all over the world answer this same question (in 140 characters or less) several times a day, and read answers their friends, acquaintances, or strangers <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(it&#8217;s the Internet after all!)</span> provide. <a href="http://edtechatouille.blogspot.com/2007/07/twitter-uniqueness-ambi-synchronous.html">Many are wondering</a> at <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2007/what-the-tweet/">what makes people Tweet</a>, but as with most Web 2.0 phenomena you can&#8217;t really know/understand what it is all about until you give it a try <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and I mean really give it a try by <span style="font-weight: bold;">actively participating</span>!)</span>.<br /><br />Here are some of my ideas of why Twitter works. Actually, answering the question <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</span> on the web is not a new idea. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s been around for years in different communities</span>; I think that most (if not all) of the forums I used to participate in had an always popular topic <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;What are we doing right now&#8221;</span>, in which members would post short (one sentence) answers. These topics were always a great way to kill time, but also to build a special connection between forum members and strengthen the forum community. In these topics you were could read small little details about members&#8217; lives - their passions, dreams, joys, frustrations and what not - and you got the feeling that you knew them a little better.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.whywerock.com/wp-content/images/2007/01/twitterrific_logo.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 108px; height: 108px;" src="http://www.whywerock.com/wp-content/images/2007/01/twitterrific_logo.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>But of course, these &#8220;Tweet topics&#8221; were constrained to a certain web place - the forum - and people get restless if they are limited to one, same old, same old place. Especially because you can&#8217;t ever find <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of your friends and other interesting people in just one place! And I think that&#8217;s where the folks at Twitter got a brilliant idea and offered the users the power to <span style="font-weight: bold;">connect socially across different places</span>. Sure, you still have to get a Twitter account, but once you get that, you can Tweet from anywhere you like - <a href="http://twitter.com/">the Twitter web site</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/blog/2007/05/theres-twitter-in-my-facebook.html">other websites</a>, your <a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=28">IM client</a>, your <a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">browser</a>, your <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/email_messaging/twidgettwitterdashboardwidget.html">dashboard</a>, your <a href="http://ordinalmalaprop.com/twitter/">Second</a> <a href="http://www.squawknest.com/about">Life</a>, your <a href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=14">mobile phone</a>,&#8230; and you can also read Tweets from your friends from any place you like! You are no longer limited to one application, one website - and I think we&#8217;ll be seeing more of that in the future of the Internet. For this reason<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Twitter is the ultimate social network - anywhere, anytime.</span> Saying &#8220;I have to go out&#8221; is usually the end of an IM conversation, but can be a start to a Twitter one! Once you set it Twitter up and find your friends, you just enjoy the ride and get connected with your social network - and along the way you can of course discover interesting Tweets from your friends&#8217; friends and expand your social network.<br /><br />Speaking of differences between Twitter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">IM</a>: people often ask why is Twitter different/better than IM? I think Twitter has some advantages over using IM. Firstly, it is not as time demanding, because you usually aren&#8217;t expected to reply immediately (although you easily can if you want to), and it takes away less time than having 10 separate IM conversations. But still - you are up-to-date with what your friends are doing, and can provide feedback if needed. And although Twitter can also be <a href="http://www.crucialthought.com/2007/07/24/twitterfox-dangerous-for-your-cognitive-health/">disruptive</a>, I think it is very easy to turn off notifications when you need to concentrate on doing something - and <span style="font-style: italic;">nobody actually knows you aren&#8217;t receiving notifications</span> (unlike with IM when your contacts know when you&#8217;re offline).  One of my Twitter friends <a href="http://twitter.com/anyaixchel">anyaixchel</a> found a perfect word to describe the communication process on Twitter: <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/2007/07/31/the-writing-and-communication-process-in-facebook-and-twitter/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ambi-synchronous</span></a>. I find Twitter communication really fascinating. It is very simple, but yet it connects people in an almost magic way. And again - I think its main advantage is that it is not limited to one single place, but is in a way <span style="font-weight: bold;">universally accessible</span> no matter where you are.<br /><br />And because of that characteristic I believe that Twitter can be used in many different ways: as a travel journal <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the expenses of sending an SMS on the road are often much lower than trying to find a computer with internet access in some places)</span>, as a flash news feed <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(see </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://twitter.com/reuters">example</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span>, as an <a href="http://twittercal.com/">event reminder</a>, as a tool for class notifications <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I wish we had Twitter when I was in school!)</span>, and many more. The Twitter mania is just starting, so I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll all be able to find many other innovative usages of this new tool.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBkFe-eHmI/AAAAAAAAAF0/JXU1g3Xm5lI/s1600-h/twitter+ialja.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 238px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RrBkFe-eHmI/AAAAAAAAAF0/JXU1g3Xm5lI/s320/twitter+ialja.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093681223933238882" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">My Twitter starting (but not the only!) point</span><br /></div>Until then you are of course all invited to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">me</a> (or anybody else ;) ) on Twitter, and maybe we can come up with some new ideas together while Tweeting about less or more important events and thoughts of our lives :)<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">By the way: Twitter is not the only bird on the block. One interesting (and great looking!) variation of Twitter is for instance <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/">Jaiku,</a> which is also great for aggregating different feeds you might have (blog, Flickr, del.icio.us etc). Have a look at <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">my Jaikus</a> for an example. Unfortunately Jaiku doesn&#8217;t (yet) support IM notifications, and so it is not as place independent as Twitter. </span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
In the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been curiously exploring <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ialja">Twitter</a>, and even <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(more about those in future posts)</span>; and that is mostly why I haven&#8217;t been posting to my blog as much as I would like to. Another thing I&#8217;ve been doing is trying out different virtual worlds (<a href="http://www.there.com/">There</a>, <a href="http://www.kaneva.com/">Kaneva</a>, <a href="http://www.multiverse.net/">Multiverse</a>, &#8230;). I was curious to see if Second Life is really the best in social virtual worlds we currently got. And I must say I now appreciate my Second Life more :)<br /><br />The reason behind my &#8220;virtual worlds exploration&#8221; is that I will probably have to do some introductory presentations about virtual worlds (and in particular Second Life) in the next few months, and that is also why I spent the past week making a &#8220;master presentation&#8221; on the subject. My goal was to create a presentation with a brief explanation of what virtual worlds are, of what is Second Life, and of different things we can do with Second Life. And here is the result:<br /><div align="center"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=83940&doc=virtual-worlds-introduction-second-life-and-beyond4228" height="348" width="425"><param name="movie" value="https://s3.amazonaws.com:443/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=83940&amp;doc=virtual-worlds-introduction-second-life-and-beyond4228"></object></div>I think this presentation can be used for different audiences by taking out some slides, so I hope you will also find it useful for some of your presentations. As it is meant as an introductory presentation, I didn&#8217;t focus on details, but rather on presenting the key facts and some of the most attractive aspects of virtual worlds and Second Life. I posted the presentation on SlideShare along with comments for each slides with links to sources I used, so I suggest you take a look at those comments as well. And of course: your comments/suggestions regarding this presentation are welcome either on SlideShare or on this post :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/presentation-second-life-and-beyond.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/presentation-second-life-and-beyond.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Just a short notice: I&#8217;m taking this week off for a short vacation at the sea. I&#8217;ll have internet access, but I&#8217;ll try to avoid it if possible (my wrists really need some rest), thought I&#8217;ll probably post little updates on <a href="http://ialja.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a>. I already have some great books packed, and I really can&#8217;t wait to relax on the beach and enjoy the sea air. I&#8217;ll be back in the digital world next week, so stay tuned! :)<br /><div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/758876237/" title="Photo Sharing"><img style="width: 347px; height: 262px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1140/758876237_a0ff22aa79.jpg" alt="Sunset in Koper" /></a></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/taking-week-off.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/taking-week-off.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday I had one of the most magical days in my <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> thanks to some really great people and a bit of magic coincidence. I haven&#8217;t had much of Second Life lately due to different first life obligations, so yesterday I had a great chance to do some catching up, and I was really reminded of why I still believe in the potentials of Second Life. Mostly, I was once again reminded of the unique way in which Second Life is able to bring people from all over together.<br /><br />First, I meet up again with <a href="http://profiles.slbuzz.com/eyebeams-electricteeth">Eyebeams Electricteeth</a> (of <a href="http://www.l4l.co.uk/?page_id=71">Learn 4 Life</a>), who has great ambitions and plans to make SL more popular among UK educators (and also abroad) and is working on some interesting projects in SL <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(you&#8217;ll probably hear more about that in the next months)</span>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he had some other things to do, so I moved on and asked to meet <a href="http://bethssecondlife.blogspot.com/">Desi</a> somewhere, as we haven&#8217;t seen each other in ages <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my fault)</span>. After mentioning that I still don&#8217;t have any place in SL, Desi kindly offered to let me use some space in their new <a href="http://collegeenglish.wikispaces.com/LiteratureAlive">Literature Alive! HQ</a> on Eduisland II. So, we went to check out the place (2nd floor), Desi brought in a couch <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(with one really funny sitting pose ;) )</span>, and we started talking. She also invited <a href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/">KJ Hax</a> over, who invited <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/">Any Ixchel</a>, and what happened was real <a href="http://www.storyofmysecondlife.com/?p=276">serendipity</a>. Later on we were also joined by Corwin Carillon, Eloise Pasteur, and Butch Dee, and we had a really inspiring discussion. We talked about Second Life in general, avatars, identity, and we also shared some useful SL tools <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(thanks for the tip about the</span> <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Blumfield/26/151/47">MystiTool HUD</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">!

Soon  Anya&#8217;s friend <a href="http://www.lostbiro.com/blog/">Aiji Ducatillon</a> joined us, and we went to Anya&#8217;s place to do some hang gliding, and playing with toys <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(Aiji thanks for the ride and the massage; Anya thanks for the giraffes and the cats! :) )</span>. It was a lot of fun, and I surely hope we can do this again sometime <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I&#8217;m glad I now have some friends from down under I can hang out with in EU friendly times :) )</span>.<br /><br />I spent rest of the day in my new &#8220;office&#8221; space Desi has kindly offered to me. I brought in a big and comfy couch, a cookie and coffee giving table <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(just touch it :) )</span>, and an info point that can tell you whether I&#8217;m online or offline and will open my blog when touched. I hope you&#8217;ll all come to visit me sometime (<a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduisland%20II/196/219/47">http://slurl.com/secondlife/Eduisland%20II/196/219/47</a>), and that we&#8217;ll be able to have more serendipitous moments in that space. Feel free to use the couch any time, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">don&#8217;t forget to invite your friends over</span>! :)<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ialja/713534279/"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 462px; height: 253px;" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1332/713534279_6c5a57c270.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(153, 153, 153); font-weight: bold;">Come over any time</span><br /></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-wonderful-second-life.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-wonderful-second-life.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2007.informingscience.org/images/logolong2007_v5.gif"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: left; cursor: pointer; width: 379px; height: 87px;" src="http://2007.informingscience.org/images/logolong2007_v5.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a>Yesterday was the last day of the <a href="http://2007.informingscience.org/">Informing Science + Information Technology Education</a> (InSITE) conference, organized by the <a href="http://informingscience.org/">Informing Science Institute</a> and hosted by the <a href="http://www.ef.uni-lj.si/en/">Faculty of Economics</a> in <a href="http://www.ljubljana-tourism.si/">Ljubljana</a>, <a href="http://www.slovenia.info/">Slovenia</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(yep, the city I live in - there&#8217;s nothing better than having a good international conference at your doorstep ;) )</span>. In the last 3 days I listen to around 25 presentations at the conference, and also presented <a href="http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2007/IISITv4p201-210Sulc388.pdf">my paper</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(yes, that is why I wasn&#8217;t online as much as usually)</span>. How was it? Well, read below :)<br /><br />I&#8217;d like to start by mentioning <span style="font-weight: bold;">some of the presentations</span> that I found most interesting and/or valuable <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(listed in order of appearance at the conference)</span>:<br /><ul><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2007/InSITE07Vyver370.pdf">The Search for the Adaptable ICT Student</a> (<a href="http://www.expertguide.com.au/%21GlenVanDerVyver%21_3361.aspx">Glen Van Der Vyver</a>): This was a presentation of the results of a study among a group of undergraduate ICT students about their adaptability (which is one of the characteristics ICT students should have). The results showed that the students have a high degree of adaptability when personal choices are involved, but not much adaptability related to job change - students like change, but expect their jobs to adapt to their lifestyles, not the other way round. I find these findings really interesting, and I would certainly like to see how adaptable our students are. </li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2007/IISITv4p535-544Kooh275.pdf">Advancing Sustainability of Open Educational Resources</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>(<a href="http://alex.a24k.com/">Alex Koohang</a>): I found this presentation interesting because it opened some interesting questions and issues related to <a href="http://www.oercommons.org/">Open Educational Resources</a> and the sustainability of OER. These are all important topics in education, and I especially liked the fact that Alex stressed the importance of including users&#8217; perspectives in further research and development of OER. </li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://jiito.org/articles/JIITOv2p015-029Travica258.pdf">Of Disobedience, Divinations, Monsters and Fumbling: Adopting a Self-Service System</a> (<a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/%7Ebtravica/">Bob Travica</a>): During this presentation we learned about some of the issues that emerged during the adoption of a self-service management system in a Canadian company. The presentation got me thinking that we don&#8217;t really pay enough attention to how our students adopt different e-learning systems, and that perhaps more detailed studies than just the usual multiple choice question &#8220;How would you grade the usability of the LMS?&#8221; should be performed. Mostly, we just have the quantitative data on how much our students like our e-learning systems, but I don&#8217;t think we know enough about how they really interact with them, and about what could be done to improve their interactions with the system. Certainly a topic to keep in mind for further research.</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://jite.org/documents/Vol6/JITEv6p311-326Jewels271.pdf">What Exactly Do You Want Me To Do?  Analysis of a Criterion Referenced Assessment Project</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>(<a href="http://staff.fit.qut.edu.au/staffDetail.jsp?id=jewels">Tony Jewels</a> and <a href="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/%7Emf/">Marilyn Ford</a>): This presentation provided a critical view on criterion referenced assessment. They pointed out that the practice of using CRA shows different results than the theory of CRA predicts. In their paper, the authors presented some interesting negative feedback they got from their students when using CRA, which in neither surprising nor new.  The authors concluded their study with a valuable suggestion: educational institutions should focus more on educating students at an early stage on skills that apply to all subjects and assignments.<br /></li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://jite.org/documents/Vol6/JITEv6p249-261Venables263.pdf">A â€˜Hands onâ€™ Strategy for Teaching Genetic Algorithms to Undergraduates</a> (<a href="http://suzuki.vu.edu.au/csm/staff.php?person=40">Anne Venables</a>): I found this presentation inspiring because Anne presented an interesting approach to teaching what at first sight appears to be a complex and unattractive topic of genetic algorithms to undergraduate students in an engaging and easy to understand way using poppet beads. Sounds interesting? It sure is, so I really suggest reading Anne&#8217;s paper that explains the approach in more detail. We definitely need more teachers like this in all our schools!</li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2007/InSITE07Goh389.pdf">To TxT or Not to TxT: That&#8217;s the Puzzle</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>(<a href="http://www.sim.vuw.ac.nz/staff/val-hooper.aspx">Val Hooper</a>): During this presentation we heard about an interesting use of SMSes to engage large groups of first year students during lectures. I like the general idea of the presented SMS X-word puzzle activity (see the paper for a detailed description), and although it is at this moment still costly and technical demanding, I liked the fact that they&#8217;ve tried to engage their students in a new way that is closer to what the students use in their everyday life. </li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2007/IISITv4p511-521Mosh288.pdf">The Educational Potential of Modified Video Games</a> (Andrew Moshirnia): This presentation was a virtual one <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(meaning: we watched a PowerPoint presentation with a voice-over explanation of the author)</span>, so we weren&#8217;t able to have a discussion with the author (which would certainly make the presentation even more interesting). Nevertheless, the presentation showed us an interesting example of using a <a href="http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm">Civilization IV</a> mod to teach American Revolution. I still believe that we&#8217;re at the very early stages of developing serious educational games, but I think it was good to have this topic presented at the conference. </li><li><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://ijklo.org/Volume3/IJKLOv3p185-196Whatley367.pdf">Using Video to Record Summary Lectures to Aid Studentsâ€™ Revision</a> (<a href="http://www.business.salford.ac.uk/staff/janicewhatley">Janice Whatley</a>): In this presentation we got an interesting example of using <a href="http://hizecool.com/amrey/">video lectures summaries with text notes</a> to help students with course revisions. Although I like the general idea of  these video summaries, I think it&#8217;d be better to give the students the ability to create their own video summaries and share them with their colleagues, or at least give the students the chance of posting and sharing their own notes for the video summaries. Still, the presentation did open some interesting questions about the usefulness and the right format of summary lectures, and I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how this project will develop in the future.<br /></li></ul><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RoEXMdldpQI/AAAAAAAAAFk/f3FxFuYkDh4/s1600-h/Screenshot_1.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 138px; height: 112px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RoEXMdldpQI/AAAAAAAAAFk/f3FxFuYkDh4/s200/Screenshot_1.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5080367357518259458" border="0" /></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">I also co-presented</span> the paper <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2007/IISITv4p201-210Sulc388.pdf">Can Online Tutors Improve the Quality of E-learning?</a>. You can check out the slides for the presentation on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/can-online-tutors-improve-the-quality-of-elearning">SlideShare</a>, but I know there aren&#8217;t of much use without the narration, so if you&#8217;ve missed the presentation and are interested about hearing more about the topic of the paper and the e-learning at <a href="http://www.fm-kp.si/eng/">my faculty</a>, I can provide an on demand voice-over through Skype <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my Skype ID: alja-skype)</span> :)<br /><br />Speaking of presentations: why is it so popular to share presenter notes with the audience through PowerPoint slides? I had the pleasure to listen to many great speakers at the conference, but unfortunately many of the interesting speeches were disturbed by great chunks of text behind their backs. I personally  can&#8217;t resist the temptation to read all the text on the slides. Unfortunately that turns my attention away from the speaker and the presentation becomes difficult to follow and to remember. A few minutes after such presentations I always wonder what the main point the presenter was trying to get across? And there is no way I can remember any of the slides. I really think these presentations would be better if the presenters turned off the projector and kept the slides full of text for themselves. If you don&#8217;t have time to practice your presentation and prepare an interesting slideshow don&#8217;t bother with using your notes on the overhead projector. And also getting all your notes on paper in advance really spoils a lot of the fun; I don&#8217;t want to know how the story will end! Please, dear presenters: surprise me, engage me!<br /><br />Apart from some bad uses of PowerPoint slides, the conference was full of interesting topics and presentations. I only wish I could have attended more, and talked to more people. Thanks to everyone that I met at the conference for all the interesting conversations we had, and I hope we can keep in touch. The <a href="http://2008.informingscience.org/">next InSITE conference</a> will take place at the nearly same date next year in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna">Varna</a>, <a href="http://www.bulgariatravel.org/eng/index.php">Bulgaria</a>, so we might meet again there.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/06/report-insite-conference-2007.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/06/report-insite-conference-2007.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
