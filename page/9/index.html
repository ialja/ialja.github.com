With great joy and pride I can finally announce the public opening of my company&#8217;s first major Second Life project: the MMC island. MMC island is an extension of Multimedia center, the new media department of Slovenian public broadcaster (<a href="http://www.rtvslo.si/">RTV Slovenija</a>). The main purpose of the island is to provide users with the ability to organize their own events on group owned and managed land. You can read more about the project in <a href="http://www.artesia.si/english/?p=159">our press release</a>.<br /><br />You can already visit the island right now, and on <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Saturday, March 29th from 10 AM to 4 PM SLT</span> we&#8217;ll be having the official opening party with 6 hours of live music and other activities (including a presentation of the project in English at 1 PM SLT).

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
A big part of what makes Second Life so appealing for me is the ability to meet and interact with interesting people from all over the world. I&#8217;ve been in Second Life for over a year now and in this time I&#8217;ve made some great friends with whom I love to discover new places in SL, have great serendipity moments or attend various events with. And we use a lot of different tools to keep in touch - mainly <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. But I often wished for an easier way to let my SL friends know about a great event going on or a great place I&#8217;m just visiting&#8230; and that is why I was really excited to discover a new Second Life tool last week called <span style="font-weight: bold;">metaHUD</span>.<br /><br />metaHUD is a HUD <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(</span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display">Head-Up Display</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> that you can wear in Second Life. The developers of metaHUD like to describe it as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">social networking platform for Second Life</span> that enables Second Life residents to share their Second Life with friends. It can also be used only as a search engine for SL  places and products and as a shopping tool, but its real power is in allowing residents to follow and use what their friends are doing. Let&#8217;s see how this is done through different parts of the HUD.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" ><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R8A9qHt-UUI/AAAAAAAAAM8/hsukipuoGPc/s1600-h/metaTRAVEL.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 139px; height: 172px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R8A9qHt-UUI/AAAAAAAAAM8/hsukipuoGPc/s200/metaTRAVEL.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5170200166057005378" border="0" /></a></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >metaTravel - Travel guide</span><br /><br />When you&#8217;re wearing the metaHUD, it keeps track of your teleport history and other activities, and stores all that into your personal <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timeline</span>. Whenever you teleport to a new place, you can rate it by simply choosing a green thumbs up or red thumbs down button. If you wish, you can also tag the place to make it easier for other metaLIFE users to find it through keyword search, and you can even leave a comment about the place. If you really like the place, you can also add it to your <span style="font-weight: bold;">Favorites</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(works similarly as the &#8220;Picks&#8221; tab in standard SL profiles)</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"><br /><span style="font-size:130%;">metaFriends and metaTIME - Social life</span></span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R8A-BXt-UVI/AAAAAAAAANE/0k60EpIFfuA/s1600-h/metaTIME.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 139px; height: 157px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R8A-BXt-UVI/AAAAAAAAANE/0k60EpIFfuA/s200/metaTIME.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5170200565488963922" border="0" /></a>Next, the metaHUD offers the ability to search for <span style="font-weight: bold;">people</span>. If your friends use metaHUD, you can view their Timeline, Favorites, Home location, choose to <span style="font-weight: bold;">follow</span> that person <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(if you follow a person, you have their updates in the Friends Timeline)</span>, and even add tags and comments to their metaHUD profile. The Timeline feature is very similar to the Facebook <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130">Mini-Feed</a> that tells you what a friend of yours has been doing on FB - in the metaHUD the Timeline tells you what a friend has been doing in SL. Also, the ability to add comments is similar to the FB wall feature. So basically, we can now have some of the useful features of web social networking sites within Second Life!<br /><br />Now, if you&#8217;re a Twitterholic like <a href="http://twitter.com/iAlja">me</a> you might wonder whether there&#8217;s also a way to post your status to friends. Well, you don&#8217;t have a separate place in the metaHUD to answer the question <span style="font-style: italic;">What are you doing?</span>, but what you can do is add comments to places you&#8217;re visiting - and that appears in your metaHUD Timeline, so friends can easily read a comment that says &#8220;There is a great concert going on in this place!&#8221;. Of course, not always the best solutions, but when I talked about this with <a href="http://www.slprofiles.com/slprofiles.asp?id=4619">Robbie Kiama</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(one of the developers)</span>, he told me that they are planning to make a RSS feed from your Timeline and add better connectivity with Twitter and similar services, which is something I&#8217;m really looking forward to!<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >metaStore - Shopping channel</span><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R8A-SHt-UWI/AAAAAAAAANM/hhNOmYrRFIo/s1600-h/metaSTORE.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 146px; height: 169px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R8A-SHt-UWI/AAAAAAAAANM/hhNOmYrRFIo/s200/metaSTORE.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5170200853251772770" border="0" /></a>And let&#8217;s not forget that the metaHUD also lets you use the metaLIFE <span style="font-weight: bold;">Meta Mart shopping system</span>, which enables you to browse items in the Meta Mart system that are for sale <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(apart form an alphabetical list you also have lists of Latest, Favorite, Popular, Purchased and Free items)</span>, search for items using keywords, rate and comment virtual items <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(thus making it easier for other user to find good content)</span>, and you can also buy items directly from the HUD itself. Kind of what you can do on <a href="http://www.slexchange.com/">SL Exchange</a> or <a href="http://shop.onrez.com/">Onrez</a>, but without having to switch back and forth between the SL viewer and your browser. The shopping feature is of course very handy, and it even allows you to teleport to the actual store if you want to<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(something I personally miss on the web shopping sites!)</span></span> and even send items as a gift to friends.<br /><br />If you&#8217;re a content creator, you can find more info on how to sell your items through the Meta Mart system on <a href="http://www.metaversemart.com/sellers_help.php">this page</a>. There is also a paid <a href="http://www.metaversemart.com/partners_help.php">Referring Partner system</a> that can earn you some L$, but I personally haven&#8217;t tried it yet.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >meta-LIFE.net - Web interface</span><br /><br />And finally, the metaHUD also generates a personal password for you, which can be used to sing in to the <a href="http://meta-life.net/">meta-LIFE.net</a> site. Here you can manage your metaHUD profile and items <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(if you&#8217;re selling your objects through the metaHUD Store)</span>, and manage your <span style="font-weight: bold;">metaHUD privacy settings</span>, so you get to decide whether your teleport info, shop history, and other actions are visible to all metaHUD users, your friends only or nobody but you.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R8BB1Xt-UYI/AAAAAAAAANc/yEAMRpSOkn4/s1600-h/meta-life-net.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R8BB1Xt-UYI/AAAAAAAAANc/yEAMRpSOkn4/s320/meta-life-net.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5170204757377044866" border="0" /></a><hr /><br />I&#8217;ve been using the metaHUD for a few days and here&#8217;s what I personally think are its<span style="font-weight: bold;"> strong points</span>:<br /><ul><li>easy to use, the interface is consistent, and the HUD is quite fast once it loads,</li><li>great list of features <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my favorite is the Friends Timeline)</span>,</li><li>customized privacy settings,</li><li>doesn&#8217;t obstruct your view too much when minimized.</li></ul>But of course, the product was just released and there is always room for some more improvement. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s on <span style="font-weight: bold;">my wish list</span> for the next versions:<br /><ul><li>a version that can be used on the left or even top/bottom part of the screen <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(currently the HUD is made for the right side of the screen, which in my case is already taken by other HUDs, so it&#8217;d be great to have more choice)</span>,</li><li>the option to receive an IM when chosen actions from Friends happen<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"></span>,<br /></li><li>more web connectivity <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(especially with Twitter)</span>,</li><li>added support for events <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the ability to announce events and sign up for events)</span>.</li></ul>But all in all I think the metaHUD is a great product that finally brings some Web 2.0 in-world. I&#8217;ll certainly be keeping an eye on the metaLIFE team for future projects, as they really have some great ideas. Yesterday they also released <a href="http://metamart.blogspot.com/2008/02/presenting-metapresenter.html">metaPRESENTER</a>, a presentation screen for SL that is controlled through a HUD. Pretty neat! You can of course get your free metaPRESNTER through the metaHUD, which you can pick up at the in-world <a href="http://slurl.com/secondlife/Sobaeksan/200/201/66">Meta Mart location</a>. And please, do feel free to leave a comment under this post with you opinion about the metaHUD, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think about it!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2008/02/metahud-bringing-web-20-to-second-life.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2008/02/metahud-bringing-web-20-to-second-life.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Just a brief announcement and invitation: I was invited to be the guest of the next ISTE Speaker Series Session in Second Life on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tuesday, February 19, 6 PM SLT</span>. I&#8217;ll be talking about my experience of being an online tutor and I hope you can join me for a great discussion. Here&#8217;s the official announcement from the <a href="http://secondlife.iste.wikispaces.net/events">ISTE Second Life wiki</a>:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><blockquote style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Online Tutoring Across Different Platforms </span>with Alja Sulčič (SL: iAlja Writer)<br />Alja is a virtual platform expert in Slovenia working for Artesia, a small start-up focused on building virtual communities.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I wish that me spending more time in the virtual world of <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> could be a good excuse for not blogging lately, but it really isn&#8217;t. Oh well, while I try to get into a blogging mood again, I&#8217;ve got a little something to share that will hopefully be useful to fellow SLers. I&#8217;d like to talk about Second Life group management today <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(and no, it&#8217;s not another we-need-more-groups rant - </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://phasinggrace.blogspot.com/2008/01/25-group-symptom-in-second-life.html">Grace</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> already nailed that subject better than I ever could)</span>.<br /><br />Groups are a great way for two or more people to manage a parcel of land in SL for a common project, but when you need to have a larger group of users with different skills and roles, you might want to define more roles with different abilities in the group that owns your land. For example, you might not want to give less experienced users full control of objects on group owned land, but you might want to give them the ability to send out group notices.<br /><br />And something similar is just what I&#8217;ll soon have to do on a group owned land. As I need to carefully define the roles, I wanted to have a table outside SL with all possible abilities for roles listed. I was surprised not to find such a list, so I made one on my own. You can get the list in <a href="http://www.scribd.com/word/download/2036638?extension=xls">Excel</a> and <a href="http://www.scribd.com/word/download/2036637?extension=pdf">PDF</a> format on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/">Scribd</a>.<br /><br /><div align="center"><object height="300" width="450"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="SameDomain"><param name="movie" value="http://static.scribd.com/FlashPaperS3.swf?guid=rfcv18dobbcc&amp;document_id=2036637&amp;page=1"><param name="scale" value="noScale"> <embed scale="noScale" src="http://static.scribd.com/FlashPaperS3.swf?guid=rfcv18dobbcc&amp;document_id=2036637&amp;page=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="300" width="450"></embed> </object></div><br />As there are three default roles <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Everyone</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">, </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Officer</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">, and </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Owner</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> in each SL group, I also marked which abilities each of the default role has. I also copied the comments for each of the ability. These comments are available in the Abilities tab under the Members &amp; Roles tab in the Group Information window and most of them include more details and the occasional useful warnings for group owners, so you might want to read them if you&#8217;re not sure what a role does. If you&#8217;re new to managing SL groups, you might also want to read the Knowledge Base articles about the <a href="https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4567">Group Roles</a> and about <a href="https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4041">Group Owned Land</a>. <a href="http://torley.com">Torley</a> also has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E0Y2xLd3gk">great tutorial</a> about creating groups and using the Group Information window for beginners.<br /><br />And I would love to hear how you go about defining SL group roles or any good advice/best practice you have about managing group roles and choosing abilities!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2008/02/list-of-abilities-and-roles-for-second.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2008/02/list-of-abilities-and-roles-for-second.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yes, I know it&#8217;s been awhile since my last blog post - but rest assured, I haven&#8217;t forgotten about my blog, it&#8217;s just that lately I&#8217;ve been dedicating more time to other social channels, especially <a href="http://twitter.com/iAlja">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=655122783">Facebook</a>, and of course also my <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>. I really believe that you have to get immersed in any new technology in order to really understand it and be able to figure out why it works for so many people.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.facebook.com/"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 137px; height: 50px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/R0latsTla-I/AAAAAAAAAKk/ispS-0UUrAE/s320/facebook+logo.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5136736591026678754" border="0" /></a>I already wrote about what I believe to be <a href="/2007/08/what-makes-twitters-tweet.html">the magic behind Twitter</a>, and today I&#8217;d like to share with you some of my thoughts on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Facebook</span>. I decided to choose this subject not only because I find Facebook quite fascinating, but also because there are a lot of people out there wondering what FB is all about and what it should/can be used for. In fact, FB might seem pretty straightforward, but it can take some time to figure it out. And that is why I&#8217;ve decided to share my personal experience with FB.<br /><br />Ok, let&#8217;s just start with <span style="font-weight: bold;">the basics</span>. As you probably know, FB is a very popular social networking site, which enables you to create your profile and connect with friends. In addition to this, it has its own <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">developer platform</a>, which developers can use to build different applications that enable users to do more or less useful activities. Yes, these apps only work in the closed environment of FB, making the site almost some kind of web operating system that doesn&#8217;t want to talk to the rest of the web on its own, but requires developers to learn its language <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(called </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/FBML">FBML</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> to bring the magic of the web and social interactions to it. Not surprisingly, many people criticize FB for being a walled garden, and <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is now trying hard to out open social networks with <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial</a>; but for an average Joe all this is not very relevant. If you&#8217;ve got most of your friends on FB and a lot of fun things to do, you don&#8217;t really care how it&#8217;s done, so I&#8217;ll discuss the OpenSocial vs FB platform <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(or the new FB advertising options)</span> some other time. Today, I&#8217;d just like to focus on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">user perspective about various uses of FB apps</span>, which in my opinion are the magic ingredient that make FB so appealing to an increasing number of users <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(some might add: and such a time waster ;) )</span>.<br /><br />I think we can divide FB apps, and consequently FB&#8217;s value for the users, in <span style="font-weight: bold;">three main categories</span>:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >Self-promotion and branding</span>: At its core, FB is a place where you can build your own profile. When we build an online profile, we create our online <a href="http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2007/11/gartner-says-ge.html">persona</a>, which will be seen by our friends or even the entire world. We might not realize that, but when we fill in various profile fields or choose our profile picture, we decide how we want to be presented to the world. You might want to emphasize your professional side or your fun side; but in both cases we make a choice in how we &#8220;brand&#8221; ourselves to our public <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(which we can choose by limiting our profile only to contacts for example)</span>. And there are many FB functions and apps that can help us build our persona  <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(or even our personal brand)</span>, for example: various default profile options <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(picture, interests, work &amp; education info, favorite things,&#8230;)</span>, joining groups <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(the FB groups function is awful, but I find it useful to publicly express my interest in certain topics)</span>, labeling yourself as a fan of something <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(made possible by the new product pages)</span>, your choice and variety of friends, the choice of profile layout <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(choosing which info to make public, having your <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/lastfmmusic/">music playlist</a>, favorite quotes or the result of a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/personaldna/">personality test</a> displayed, &#8230;)</span>, your FB statuses, the items that appear in our mini-feed etc.. Some people even prefer having multiple profiles for different personas <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(for example, a different account for their Second Life avatar)</span>. Building our FB persona can be quite a task, and a lot of people choose to use just this aspect of FB. They register, fill in the info and connect with friends, and use FB just to say &#8220;I&#8217;m online too - if you want to connect to me use my e-mail/phone number&#8221;. </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >Social play</span>: The next category of FB apps enables us to have fun and keep in touch with out friends. We all have busy lives, a lot of our friends live in different cities or even parts of the world, and it&#8217;s often not easy to find the time or way to hang out together. And here is where FB can help: it enables us to keep in touch with friend through different social <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(often playful)</span> activities. Even if you&#8217;re extremely busy, you can always find a minute or two to poke your friends, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/superpokey/">throw a sheep at them</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/zombies/">turn them into a zombie</a> or send them a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/growing/">virtual pet</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/growing/">flower</a> or <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/freegifts/">image</a>. All these apps help us say &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about you&#8221; in different ways. It might look silly, but it feels nice to receive virtual cakes when you set your status to ill. We often like to say &#8220;It&#8217;s the thought that counts&#8221;, and I think the social play apps in FB are a great proof of that. Also, the FB news feed, which displays various news about our friends, can help us feel closer to each other as it&#8217;s constantly reminding of people, telling us what they are doing and providing an easy way to interact with them <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(&#8220;Click here to hug your friend too&#8221;)</span>. Sure, the feed items are a great way for developers to promote their app, but it does have some positive side effects I&#8217;ve just mentioned.<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);font-size:130%;" >(Social) toolbox</span>: The last category of apps is represented by a set of utilities that can help you save time, provide useful information and even be more organized. These apps can make FB a more &#8220;serious&#8221; tool. They enable us things like <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/fmailclient/">checking our e-mail</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/myoffices/">collaborating on documents</a> with friends, getting info about <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/myoffices/">weather</a>, keeping track of <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/timezones/">what time it is for our friends that live in different time zones</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my latest favorite app!)<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, displaying <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/blogfriends/">latest blog entries</a> from your friends and yourself</span></span> and much more. These apps are the main reason why people are considering using FB as a business tool or even an <a href="http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/08/08-07-06tdc/08-07-06dnews-02.asp">e-learning tool</a>. It&#8217;s comfortable to be able to do so many different things <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(from play to work)</span> on one single site, and if we want so, we can even make our &#8220;serious&#8221; activities social by choosing to display info from utility apps on our profile, and thus provide some valuable info to our contacts <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(I like to use </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.facebook.com/posted.php">FB Posted Items</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> for this purpose)</span>.</li></ul>These categories can of course often be overlapping - for example, social play apps or social toolbox apps can be used as a branding tool, and often the line between social play and social toolbox can be a fine one. An important point to remember here is that <span style="font-weight: bold;">you don&#8217;t need to use every aspect of Facebook; use what makes sense to you</span>. It&#8217;s fine if you just want to create a basic profile, and it&#8217; fine if you just want to use FB as a social toolbox and ignore the play aspects.<br /><br /><hr /><br />I&#8217;d like to conclude this post with some <span style="font-weight: bold;">basic Facebook tips</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"></span> that I hope can help you in the process of getting to know FB and finding the added value of this tool for you:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Play with FB, but make sure you&#8217;ve got friends to play with.</span> Try out different apps, explore, and be curious, but try not to annoy your friends while doing that. You don&#8217;t have to send out invites to ALL of your friends for EVERY app you add (there&#8217;s always a Skip button!). Show your friends you care and know them by sending them invitations for apps that you are pretty sure will be interesting for them.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take some time to adjust your privacy settings.</span> Decide which info/activities can be public, for friends or entirely private. You can also decide whether you want your name to appear in search or not. In the future we&#8217;ll have the abilities to group friends and have different profiles for close friends, professional contacts, family etc.; but until we don&#8217;t, try to figure out the best way to present yourself to all the people on your contacts list. You might want consider using the limited profile contacts you don&#8217;t know well. You can find all these settings under the Privacy link in the upper right corner.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remember that you don&#8217;t need to have every app you use on your profile.</span> You can access apps from the left-hand menu or the application list. Removing an app box from your profile only will not delete the app, and you will still be able to receive gifts, bite chumps and do all the other *fun* activities. Your friends can often see your app info <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(for example: </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://apps.facebook.com/likeness/">Linkeness score</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> from the app itself, so there&#8217;s really no need to keep everything on your profile. I know it&#8217;s not easy, but try not to overload your profile page. When I choose what I want on my profile or not, I like to think about what info I can provide to a new friend that want to get to know me better, and what info I can provide to friends that I haven&#8217;t spoken in a while. So, to put it simply, take care of your persona, and remember that you can choose the visibility for each profile element. Some info are for friends only while you might want to have some available public.</li></ul>But of course, this post is based entirely of my Facebook experience in the past few months, and I&#8217;m sure we all have our own story to tell. So I&#8217;m really interested in hearing <span style="font-weight: bold;">your Facebook story</span>: how and why are you using FB, and what is in your opinion the added value of FB over other social networks? Also, what do you think are the best tips you could give to people just starting with FB or people still trying to figure out what the fuss is about?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/11/facebook-what-why-how.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/11/facebook-what-why-how.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
