Another interesting article I read on <a href="http://www.educause.edu/" target="_blank">EDUCAUSE</a> today was <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Myth about No Significant Difference</span>  (view the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/apps/er/erm06/erm0667.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a> or <a href="http://www.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/erm0667.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> version) by <a href="http://www.educause.edu/PeerDirectory/750?ID=28818" target="_blank">Diana G. Oblinger</a> and <a href="http://www.educause.edu/PeerDirectory/750?ID=05619" target="_blank">Brian L. Hawkins</a>. The authors argue with the supposed no significant difference (for more info about this phenomena check out the <a href="http://www.nosignificantdifference.org/" target="_blank">official website</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22no+significant+difference%22" target="_blank">Google the term</a>) that the introduction of technology brings to education by posing the question &#8220;Difference in what?&#8221; and presenting more detailed questions that should be asked when evaluating and planning the introduction of ICT in education.<br /><br />I agree with the ideas presented in the article. Judging from our own research and even personal experiences I think that technology by itself can&#8217;t make learning better or even worse. Technology is just a tool that must be used wisely and our research shows that human support is a more important factor for successful learning than the technology that we use. From my experience as an online tutor I can say that students simply expect the technology to be simple and reliable, because they don&#8217;t want to waste time on figuring out how something works, but their judgment on the quality of e-learning is based on how they interact with other students and faculty staff. Our students really appreciated and praised the constant tutor support - the fact that they could always ask for additional explanations or information and the fact that they were getting constant feedback on their work and progress.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/316285/happy-ict.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/320/26292/happy-ict.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>Also, I think that the possibilities for interaction and collaboration are what make technology so appealing. Of course it&#8217;s great to use a word processors as they make writing so easy and fast (well, most of the times - at least up to the point when they *cough* Microsoft Word *cough* start having their own weird moods :-] ), but what is really making ICT increasingly popular and appealing is the chance to connect to other users. We don&#8217;t buy a computer because we want to <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> a computer, but because we want to <span style="font-style: italic;">do something</span> with it - and in most of the cases &#8220;doing something&#8221; involves connecting with other people - either by chatting with friends, accessing various opinions, creative expressions, hear news about people around the world, play an online game or  do research and learn new things. Whenever my Internet connection is down I really feel that my computer has become less useful, less interesting.<br /><br />To wrap things up - in my opinion (and experiences) technology doesn&#8217;t in fact make a significant difference if it isn&#8217;t used for a good purpose and if it tries to replace or remove human interactions. If people use technology for the right tasks and to improve interaction and collaboration with each other, I believe that it can make a difference - in most of the cases a positive one!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/no-significant-difference-in-what.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/no-significant-difference-in-what.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
These days I&#8217;m a bit less active on my blog because I&#8217;m struggling with the statistic analysis of the surveys and data about tutor support for the E-business course that is delivered through a virtual classroom (for more info on the course check one of <a href="/do-e-business-students-need-to-learn.html">my previous posts</a>). And so it is only fair to share some findings that already surfaced during the analysis. I actually found out that tutor&#8217;s activity (i. e. number of post) has significant positive effects on how students grade their tutor. However, the number of students&#8217; posts shows no correlation with the number of posts from the online tutor. In other words - students have to write a certain number of posts to complete the task anyway and the number of posts by the tutor serves mainly to increase the satisfaction with the tutor&#8217;s work. What the tutor usually does in his/her posts is to answer questions, lead students in the right direction and that is why it is not surprising that students are more satisfied with e-learning in general and are able to focus on learning and not on their doubts and technical problems. Also, the frequency with which the tutor checks in the virtual classroom positively affects the grades students assign to their tutor. Of course, these results are mainly based on quantitative analysis and don&#8217;t say much about the quality of post, but I think they represent a good starting point for further development of tutor support (and also future training courses for online tutors).<br /><br />So, that&#8217;s just a brief update on my research work and findings. If you&#8217;ve got similar experiences to share or questions about my research feel free to leave a note :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/online-tutors-and-student-satisfaction.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/online-tutors-and-student-satisfaction.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Today I came across an interesting post in the <a href="http://www.speedofcreativity.org/" target="_blank">Moving at the Speed of Creativity</a> blog in which there&#8217;s a short description of the flow experience as described by the psychologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi" target="_blank">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>. For a definition of the flow experience I suggest reading the post <a href="http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2006/11/23/flow-curiosity-and-engaging-education/" target="_blank">Flow, curiosity, and engaging education</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>.<br /><br />The post and ideas that are presented caught my attention because I think that educators should be aware of this phenomena and consider it when preparing activities for our students. This is especially important when we&#8217;re trying to present e-learning to students that have low ICT skills. In this case the chosen online learning environment and especially the human support should be simple and available enough to represent a manageable challenge for students - but on the other hand we should consider students that are &#8220;digitally native&#8221; and give them enough challenges to avoid boredom. And of course - here comes the tricky part. How can we find an equilibrium and satisfy all groups of students?<br /><br />Perhaps one way to solve this problem could be to motivate students with higher skills to help students with lower skills - in this way experienced users get some challenges while newbies get the needed support and the ability to improve their &#8220;digital&#8221; skills and begin the &#8220;digital immigration&#8221; process. Also, in this way students start learning how to cooperate online, start building a positive online community, and construct knowledge and group identity. And let&#8217;s not forget that this method could also be used by faculty staff - teacher and tutors after all have different attitudes and skills towards e-learning and I think that building an online support community within an organization can strengthen relationship between teachers/tutors, improve skills and attitudes toward ICT, and consequently contribute to a more effective delivery of e-learning courses. I certainly think we should be giving this idea a try in our practical work and engage more people in the flow where they&#8217;ll be receptive and positive about learning new things and skills!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/getting-into-flow.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/getting-into-flow.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

The conference was focused on management and business topics, but there was also an e-learning section. There weren&#8217;t many papers in that section, so I didn&#8217;t really attend to many of the presentations. But of the presentations I did attend, I most enjoyed <a href="http://www.uwm.edu/People/koohang/" target="_blank">Alex Koohang</a>&#8217;s presentation of his paper <span style="font-style: italic;">In Search of a Learner-Centered Instructional Model for Blended Learning</span> in which he presented his blended learning model (in this context blended means half face-to-face and half online learning) and some of the constructivist methods he uses with his students. And although our students come from a different background, I think that they could benefit from the methods that Alex mentioned. I really liked the idea of students writing short essays with their reactions to some material and then having to read, comment, analyze and react to essays written by their pears. That&#8217;s really constructivism in action!<br /><br />I will be posting the link to my and other interesting full articles from the conference as soon as they are available online.

I already revealed myself as a Google fan in <a href="/2006/10/why-do-i-google.html">one of my previous posts</a> and again there&#8217;s some great news coming from Google that can be in my opinion be useful in education. Here&#8217;s the thing - <a href="http://pages.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Page Creator</a> now has some extra powerful features. As described in the post <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/simplicity-and-power.html" target="_blank">Simplicity and power</a>, you can now edit images you upload to Google Page Creator within the browser (not in Safari though :( ), you can multiple sites with different addresses and the feature I&#8217;m most exited about: all sites made with Google Page Creator have a mobile edition without you having to move a finger! Now that is cool! I really appreciate all the support Google is giving to mobile devices.<br /><br />These new feature and the existing simplicity of the service yet again confirm <a href="/2006/10/do-e-business-students-need-to-learn.html">my opinion</a> that our students should be using web publishing tools to make web sites. Goodbye FrontPage, hello Google Page Creator! Making web sites is now easy, intuitive and when necessary you can still edit the HTML code (that is if you&#8217;re a geek like me and want to have complete control of the code :) ) But for our students Google Page Creator is in my opinion a wonderful tool to learn about how web sites work, practice linking in between sites and plan the structure of a site - which is after all what they&#8217;ll mostly be required to understand in their professional lives. And most importantly - tools like that give the students the freedom to focus on the content and forget about  the dull (for most of the students) technical details of what they are doing.<br /><br />We&#8217;re still discussing about how to restructure the E-business course for the next year and though many options are still open (wikis, blogs) I really think Google Page Creator is a serious player in this game!<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(By the way: </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://alja.sulcic.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">Here</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">&#8217;s my first Google Page :) Easy to make, easy to publish.)</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/google-page-maker-simplicity-and-power.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/google-page-maker-simplicity-and-power.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Podcasting - yes, another of the new e-learning buzz words. Another buzz word I think that we should be researching and trying to find out how it could be useful to our students.<br /><br />And just what are these podcasts everybody is talking about? Basically, podcasts are audio files (usually mp3) that are described by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed" target="_blank">web feed</a> (using RSS or Atom standards) and that can be downloaded and played on personal computers or portable media devices. (Read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasts" target="_blank">podcasts on Wikipedia</a>)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/172415/podcast.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/5516/4465/400/310096/podcast.png" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />The benefit of having a web feed describing audio files is that applications that understand web feed can alert us when a new audio file is added to a certain channel and even automatically download this file to our computers. Which means that you don&#8217;t have to manually check for updates on your favorite podcast channels, but you can let your favorite program do the checking and downloading for you. Pretty cool, right?<br /><br />Now, podcast channels can of course be also used in education. You can record lectures, additional instructions, information or feedback and students can download this content and listen to it at home or on the road using their iPods, Zunes, mobile phones or any other portable device. In this way they can learn whenever they want and at a chosen pace. For example - I always wished I could fast forward parts of the lectures that were already known to me and focus more on parts that were new or particularly interesting to me. Of course that can&#8217;t be done during traditional lectures, because there is a whole class of students with different needs, knowledge and interests the lecturer must accommodate to. But learning with podcasts is different. You can choose the appropriate time for learning and use the recording of a lecture in any way you want - you can for example review only parts of the lecture that you did not fully understand.<br /><br />And it is because of the learning flexibility that podcasts offer that I think we should try out this form of delivery and see how students react to it. I also think it&#8217;s great that we can use our existing e-classroom for this purpose, as there is a simple podcasting module available for our LMS <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> (the <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=378" target="_blank">Ipodcast module</a>).<br /><br />So, I hope we&#8217;ll be able to test podcasting at our faculty and if and when we do so, I&#8217;ll surely be posting observations and results on this blog. For now here&#8217;s a list of articles about podcasts, the process of making podcasts and the uses of podcasting in education that I&#8217;ve used for making a short paper about podcasting for our teachers:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://recap.ltd.uk/articles/podguide.html" target="_blank">Exploiting the educational potential of podcasting</a></li><li><a href="http://radio.about.com/od/podcastin1/a/aa030805a.htm" target="_blank">How to Create Your Own Podcast - A Step-by-Step Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="http://www.podcastingnews.com/articles/How-to-Podcast.html" target="_blank">Make Your First Podcast</a></li><li><a href="http://www.learninginhand.com/podcasting/index.html" target="_blank">Podcasting in Education</a></li><li><a href="http://www.learningcircuits.org/2005/jun2005/0506_trends" target="_blank">Trend: Podcasting in Academic and Corporate Learning </a></li></ul><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(By the way: if you want a taste of podcasts I suggest listening to the podcast channel </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">60-Second Science</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> that offers short daily bits of interesting science.
