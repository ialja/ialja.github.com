  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html">The Game of Thrones TV series</a> gave me a much needed kick in the ass to start reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> series of fantasy novels by <a href="http://georgerrmartin.com/">George R. R. Martin</a>. Again. I actually read the first book or two a couple years ago, around the time when the fourth book was coming out. Even though I found the story amazing, I somehow never got to the other books. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DfKojCXOrOM/UG1YUS4vpdI/AAAAAAAAAVE/mGfsL6XxIrs/s1600/Game-of-Thrones.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DfKojCXOrOM/UG1YUS4vpdI/AAAAAAAAAVE/mGfsL6XxIrs/s400/Game-of-Thrones.png" width="580" /></a></div><br />Watching the TV show did however remind me of the books, and considering the fact that I recently plowed through all three&nbsp;Fifty Shades&nbsp;books without punching something or somebody, I decided it was about time I actually read something brilliantly written for a change.<br /><br />And I&#8217;ve been completely immersed in the series for a while now. It&#8217;s probably one of the only reasons why I still voluntarily put up with the awful public transit in Ljubljana - I found out that I can read a lot on my iPhone while waiting for the bus or riding the bus in peak hours. Which is probably why you always find me at the bus stations minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive. More time waiting for the bus = more reading time. <br /><br />One of the reasons why I love the series so much is the fact that it gives you a very realistic feel of the world. It&#8217;s crude, it&#8217;s real, and it&#8217;s full of complex characters that actually feel human. There&#8217;s nothing romantic about Martin&#8217;s knights. They bleed like everyone else, drink like most, and smell rotten after a week in prison. On the other hand, I can’t really say I know Aragorn that well.<br /><p>And there is a particularly interest aspect in the books for me: the slowness of communication and how utterly unaware most characters are about what&#8217;s going on in the rest of the world. They don&#8217;t have Twitter to cover the latest rumors about the dragons from across the sea. They don&#8217;t have paparazzi following queen Cersei around King&#8217;s Landing. They can&#8217;t make threats to distant foes in a blink of an eye through SMS or email. They don&#8217;t have people making &#8220;King Joffrey totally looks like his uncle Jaime&#8221; posters on <a href="http://roflrazzi.cheezburger.com/totallylookslike">meme sites</a>.</p><a name='more'></a>No, in a world where ravens and messengers on horses are the main tools for distance communication, information becomes valuable. If you&#8217;re good at gathering and distributing information, you can earn yourself a high place at the court, like the eunuch Varys. Messages take a long time to travel, and there are no read receipts. You can&#8217;t really be sure that the raven you sent hasn&#8217;t been shot down by an archer in training or worse, fallen into the wrong hands.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ebtCsoxP2fY/UG1WTUW1I2I/AAAAAAAAAUs/KsdFEl_xqIw/s1600/Varys.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ebtCsoxP2fY/UG1WTUW1I2I/AAAAAAAAAUs/KsdFEl_xqIw/s1600/Varys.jpg" width="580" /></a></div><br />You’d think the consequences of this would be devastating. In truth? Eh, sure, having more intel would speed up the game of thrones, but most folk just couldn’t care less. At least nobody wastes their every waking moment obsessing about getting all the news and gossip. If a raven makes it to your place, you get news from a distant place. But most days, you don&#8217;t, so you’re forced to deal with people around you. And you can just get along with your life without the fear of missing out on something important. <br /><br />And because the cost of sending information is so high (you have to have a trained bird and time to spare), there&#8217;s a special art in writing your letters. You can&#8217;t afford to send a &#8220;u there?&#8221; to the other side of the continent. Quills are almost as powerful as swords, and you have to think carefully about what and how you want to write. A simple mistake or misunderstanding could have tragic consequences and you can’t make it right with a simple “Sorry, damn autocorrect!” SMS.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IzbBEyVpyy0/UG1WUNwCk9I/AAAAAAAAAUw/6C7rVnWzQGs/s1600/raven-winterfell.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IzbBEyVpyy0/UG1WUNwCk9I/AAAAAAAAAUw/6C7rVnWzQGs/s1600/raven-winterfell.jpg" width="580" /></a></div><br />Compare that to our hyper connected world. In some ways, it is a true blessing. Information can flow freely, dictators have a harder time holding onto their iron thrones, we can create new content from people around the world. However, as it is in our nature, we don&#8217;t always use the tools at hand for good. We use Twitter to complain about insignificant things nobody cares about, we use our high-tech cameras to document the food we eat (guilty as charged!), but most tragically, we live in constant fear of missing out, so we keep reaching out to others, demanding attention. NOW!<br /><br />Email is often the biggest offender. It&#8217;s so easy to write an email, it made us all more sloppy at what we do. We&#8217;re less careful about our work, because in the back of our mind we know that others will soon drop us an email if we forget to do something. We are less confident about our work because we’re always coordinating stuff, waiting for the boss’ blessing. We are constantly scrutinized, every little mistake amplified to absurdity. A great example: Apple Maps. Technology sure is a wonderful thing, but we&#8217;ve come to expect too much of it sometimes. Yeah, I hear ya, pushing boundaries is great and all, but what if we just all took a deep breath and looked around at the big picture.<br /><br />That’s why I’m really starting to like this new, radical idea of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2012/10/why-im-joining-the-movement-to-stop-answering-after-hours-email.php">no after-hours emails</a> *gasp* Back to the basics. The world isn&#8217;t going to end if you don&#8217;t see that email right now. We all need time to recharge, time for ourselves when we aren&#8217;t thinking about what we have to do next and how to please everyone else. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do love what I&#8217;m doing (most days), always searching for news, trends, creating something new. But I&#8217;m truly happy when I can focus on one thing. When I can get lost in the flow of the moment without interruptions. Getting lost in a good book or writing my own story so intently that I forget to eat and sleep, going on a Sunday long run, making a cat happy and purring while he warms my lap or shoulder, getting lost in my husband&#8217;s arms or smile. Those are the moments I treasure the most, not the moments of &#8220;waiting for the important email&#8221;.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not saying we should just go back to middle ages, riding horses instead of cars (although that would be a pretty sweet thing!), fighting each other over stupid titles and lands, throwing all our wonderful tech away. No, I couldn&#8217;t do that to Siri. But perhaps we should think more about the value of communication, information. Make emails more valuable, not just these annoying nudges in our ribs. If you’re getting nudged often enough, you’ll eventually end up bruised or worse, with a broken rib. <br /><br />But perhaps we could bring back the ravens (not necessarily in physical form) for some of the things we do. Wouldn&#8217;t it be refreshing to get a raven with a general outline of what you have to do, and then you&#8217;d have to figure out how to do it without asking for more instructions or constant feedback? Sure, feedback is great, but email only gives you feedback from you loyal small council, which, more often than not, has no perspective on the lives of the smallfolk, yet is full of conflicting self-centered interests.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L-4CVVwiv10/UG1XkTCdXNI/AAAAAAAAAU8/aSSDh2i3FTU/s1600/games+of+thrones+small+council.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L-4CVVwiv10/UG1XkTCdXNI/AAAAAAAAAU8/aSSDh2i3FTU/s400/games+of+thrones+small+council.jpg" width="580" /></a></div><br />Why don’t we put more emphasis on getting out of the door, out of the office, wander the village asking for help? Maybe join a coworking space and get feedback from people from other industries outside your own bubble. I suspect we might end up with better ideas this way.<br /><br />I say, let’s bring back value to exchanging information, don’t treat it like a commodity. Maybe imagine a poor raven flying out whenever you press that Send button. Does the Raven really have to fly for what you have to say? Will more ravens be required to fly back and forth because you’ve spent too little time writing your message? Or maybe we&#8217;d just be better off with a meeting over beer/coffee/tea (and cake)?<br /><br />Yeah, it might just be that I’ve been reading too much fantasy lately and that is why my head is filled with ravens. Still, I do think we can an should be kinder to each other. Focus less on making noise and more on creating value.<br /><br /><i>P.S.: All images property of HBO.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>There&#8217;s a big shift happening in the world of consumer applications. The web is finally becoming a true visual medium. We are finally leaving the limitations of the early, text-based web and computers and embracing visual creative thinking.</p>Want some proof? <a href="http://instagr.am/"><b>Instagram</b></a>. Photo sharing mobile app with artsy filters <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17658264">sold to Facebook for 1 billion USD</a>. <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/30/instagram-50-million-users/">50 million users</a>, popular among teens. <a href="/2012/01/im-in-love-with-pinterest-and-why-that.html"><b>Pinterest</b></a>. One of the <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/04/05/pinterest-third-most-popular-social-network/">fastest growing social web sites</a>, centered around visual bookmarking, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/28/google-plus-ghost-town/">easily beats Google+ on engagement</a>. <a href="http://omgpop.com/drawsomething"><b>Draw Something</b></a>. Insanely popular mobile game, making millions of users finger paint with a childlike joy. Something is going on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BkXE-f3Epnc/T6pkeGCifhI/AAAAAAAAAK0/QsrdgbH74F4/s1600/instagram-pinterest-draw_something-cinemagram.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BkXE-f3Epnc/T6pkeGCifhI/AAAAAAAAAK0/QsrdgbH74F4/s1600/instagram-pinterest-draw_something-cinemagram.jpg" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b>In the beginning there was text and code</b></span><br /><br />Back in the early days of the web (and computer science, of course) it was all about text. Text was easy to transfer over painfully slow internet connections. Just look at early HTML - all those tags were designed to define text. Just one &lt;img&gt;&nbsp;tag for images. Now, of course we have super fancy CSS style sheets that make almost any design you can come up with in Photoshop possible on the web without image hacks. And it&#8217;s not really a problem anymore to have an image heavy website.<br /><br />Yet a lot of the services we use daily are still heavily based around text. E-mail is of course an obvious example, but traditional blogs, even social networks like Facebook and Twitter have been designed around text. Text messages, status updates. But this is changing. <a href="/2011/07/making-tumblr-my-online-home.html"><b>Tumblr</b></a>, a more visually oriented blogging platform, is becoming a more popular way to blog. And we create content for our Facebook and Twitter feeds with Instagram or Pinterest.<br /><br />This doesn&#8217;t mean that text is just disappearing. Of course not. <a href="http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2012/nt-2012-02-13-Why-ugly.htm">Ugly websites are still great at getting the job done</a>. It&#8217;s just that text is not in the spotlight anymore when it comes to user generated content. Photos and videos are much more fun to click on, seeing someone doing something is believing!<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b>Mobile devices as a catalyst for visual expression</b></span><br /><br />Mobile devices are of course a big cause for that. Touching text on a touch screen phone or tablet isn&#8217;t as fun as pinching in on a high res photo. The new &#8220;resolutionary&#8221; iPad demands website to get prettier, and mobile apps are becoming little works of art.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Mobile devices are of course making it easier to produce visual content. It&#8217;s never been easier to take a photo or shoot a video. Or even paint a sketch with our fingers in a fantastic app like <b><a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper</a></b>! We always have our mobile devices in our pockets, and we are finding that it&#8217;s actually easier to express ourselves visually than with text. A picture really is worth a thousand words.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EtcBOcty44E/T6paRrWYPlI/AAAAAAAAAKU/rKfpeo7GS8U/s1600/iphone-camera.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EtcBOcty44E/T6paRrWYPlI/AAAAAAAAAKU/rKfpeo7GS8U/s1600/iphone-camera.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Is it any wonder that the camera is one of the most loved features of iPhone 4S?</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>When I look at my Instagram history, each photo evokes emotions like no text-based status update can. I remember the moment more vividly, I remember how and where I was sitting or standing when I took the photo, and I can almost remember the full scent and touch of that moment….<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b>Learning to draw and paint to foster creative thinking</b></span><br /><br />Like it or not, vision has always been an important part of our species from an evolutional point of view. Writing is an artifact, while the ability to observe our environment with our eyes is deeply embedded in us. And we are just now learning a new visual language, a language that has historically been the domain of various visual artists and too difficult to master for common folk. But now anyone can take a photo with a mobile phone in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />No, it doesn&#8217;t mean everyone is an artist now, just like being able to write doesn&#8217;t make you a good writer. But I do believe we are witnessing a revival of visual communication. And consequently encouraging people to engage their creative parts of the brain. Instagram isn&#8217;t about logic, it&#8217;s about emotion.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ErmunTR5Pes/T6pdSxKex0I/AAAAAAAAAKg/7zscZgK2DXI/s1600/instagram-crow-ialja.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ErmunTR5Pes/T6pdSxKex0I/AAAAAAAAAKg/7zscZgK2DXI/s320/instagram-crow-ialja.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">One of my favorite Instagram photos</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>While the fact that we are writing less and creating images with fancy filters more might worry some, I do believe it&#8217;s a sign of progress. Our education has emphasized logic and shunned creativity for far too long. We live in a world of big problem that require big ideas. Not just logical ideas, but crazy, insane, passionate ideas.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b>Rediscovering intuition for big ideas</b></span><br /><br />And that means engaging our creative side. Rediscovering intuition. Steve Jobs is a great example of how intuition can guide us towards great solutions. Yes, we need logic to develop the technology, but intuition and liberal arts are also valuable tools that can steer the technology into the right direction. And allow us to see and wonder at the big picture. To pursue beauty and value, not just revenue.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KfWkMUYJQuI/T6piMR9ZZQI/AAAAAAAAAKs/pJqNTagMK8k/s1600/instagram-ialja.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KfWkMUYJQuI/T6piMR9ZZQI/AAAAAAAAAKs/pJqNTagMK8k/s1600/instagram-ialja.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Instagram helps us find beauty in everyday moments</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Am I stretching it too far? Perhaps. I like to dream big. But something is going on. Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Draw Something, Cinemagram, Viddy, Socialcam… these are not just coincidences. It&#8217;s an emerging trend we can no longer ignore.<br /><br />In fact, I think we all need to embrace it, and to foster the creativity in our kids, in ourselves. Teach ourself design thinking and creative problem solving. We all need to become a little <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/steve-jobs-told-students-stay-hungry-stay-foolish/2011/10/05/gIQA1qVjOL_blog.html">more hungry and foolish</a> to better prepare ourselves for the uncertain future ahead of us.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/05/instagram-and-new-renaissance-of-visual.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/05/instagram-and-new-renaissance-of-visual.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a confession to make. There is a new website that is capturing an increasing number of spare minutes in life. It provides an endless stream of visual inspiration, and every time you use it, you can&#8217;t help but feel a bit more creative. Yep, I&#8217;m in love with <a href="http://pinterest.com/"><b>Pinterest</b></a>, the latest over-hyped tech media darling.</p>I did try to resist it, I swear. When I saw the first blog posts about it, I thought I didn&#8217;t need a service like that. I tried to convince myself that Tumblr and Instagram were enough for me. And I didn&#8217;t want to fall into the whole &#8221;<a href="http://www.maternalinstinct.com/2011/11/21/5-reasons-pinterest-catnip-women/">women love Pinterest</a>&#8221; stereotype. But then, as the hype kept growing, I gave in to my curiosity and a professional dedication to trying out all the new cool social services in town. And I haven&#8217;t looked back ever since. Why is that, and why does it matter?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://pinterest.com/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wwpX6y87uyI/TyAEYExDXDI/AAAAAAAAAJA/aB5Dro8MNOQ/s1600/pinterest-ialja.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Pint-huh-ha?</span></b><br /><br />So, what is the big deal? <a href="http://pinterest.com/about/">Pinterest describes itself</a> as a virtual pinboard, a place where you can <i>&#8220;organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web&#8221;</i>. Often, you see it described as a bookmarking service with a focus on images. If you ask me, all these descriptions don&#8217;t really encapsulate the real spirit of the service. Pinterest in basically a great visual experience that you have to try on your own to really get it.<br /><br />Using it is pretty simple: you drag a &#8220;Pin It&#8221; bookmarklet to your browser&#8217;s bookmarks bar, and then click on it whenever you stumble on an interesting image on the web. If you&#8217;ve got a minute to spare, you can see how easy the whole thing is in the video below:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/L2tImC_2Gnw" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Of course, you can also &#8220;repin&#8221; images other Pinterst users share. Regardless of whether you create your own original pins or play the curator and just choose the best pins from the community to highlight, each pin helps you construct your own visual board around different themes. And you can even create collaborative boards with your friends.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">What can we learn from Pinterest?</span></b><br /><br />As you can see, the service itself is pretty straightforward. However, if we scratch the surface a little, we can easily find simple, yet valuable secret ingredients that can help any service or product become more awesome in today&#8217;s competitive world:<br /><br /><b>1) Delight and surprise the curious animal inside me or I&#8217;ll move on</b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbarronoss/2407592576/" title="Curious by dbarronoss, on Flickr"><img alt="Curious" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3079/2407592576_b433990b06.jpg" /></a></div><br /><i>aka</i><b><i> Build insanely great user experiences</i>:</b> It&#8217;s never been easier to design and create stunning user interfaces that captivate users&#8217; attention. This is not the web we knew in 1995 (<a href="http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/">remember?</a>). Honestly, what is your excuse for not investing into good design and a polished user experience? No resources left?<br /><br />Well then, what in the world makes you think I&#8217;m going to spend my precious time figuring out where to click next or how to open your box? Don&#8217;t be selfish, take my hand and show me where you want me to go. I don&#8217;t have time to waste for aimless wandering among buttons, site maps and what now. I&#8217;m a curious animal, who wants to be delighted and surprised.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-secret-to-pinterests-astounding-success-a-brilliant-sign-up-process-you-should-copy-2012-1">Look at how Pinterest makes it easy for users to signup, connect with their friends, and discover cool content right from the start</a>. It&#8217;s an insanely great learning experience!<br /><br /><b>2) The importance of spotting the snake in the bush and telling your friends about it&nbsp;</b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonkeegan/935041912/" title="Black Racer (zoomed) by jonkeegan, on Flickr"><img alt="Black Racer (zoomed)" src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1130/935041912_11b33dd028.jpg" /></a></div><br /><i>aka <b>We&#8217;re all social visual learners</b></i><b>:</b> Yes, looks matter. Not because you can attract women with pointless &#8220;bling&#8221; (that, of course, couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth). Looks matter because evolutionally we have been programmed to be keen visual learners. Those of our ancestors, whom failed to spot the snake in the bush, didn&#8217;t live to tell the tale. And that is what makes all of us naturally curious visual observers.<br /><br />And it is why Pinterest is such a magical place. Everywhere you look, it&#8217;s just full of beautiful photos your eyes can feast upon. <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~cogsci/cogpsy/theeuwes/Visual_Cognition_2006_Faces.pdf">Research has shown that faces capture our attention</a> like nothing else, so why are you still building websites, writing books, making videos etc. that don&#8217;t have a face, that don&#8217;t focus on people? Images are a very powerful universal language for connecting people. And social is not just a buzz word, it&#8217;s the best way to learn, discover, and have fun.<br /><br />Us girls have an especially good nose for great social and visual experiences, that&#8217;s why Pinterest is such a bit hit and is able to attract typically non early adopters. It isn&#8217;t just about women, though attracting female users early on is certainly a good sign that you&#8217;re onto something good. Most importantly though, <a href="http://ialja.com/post/16459626047/design-for-how-people-learn-voices-that-matter">learn about what makes us tick as human beings</a>, and apply it to whatever your doing.<br /><br /><b>3) Don&#8217;t make me walk on land when I&#8217;m enjoying a swim in the ocean</b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kankan/19828575/" title="Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium by Kanko*, on Flickr"><img alt="Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/15/19828575_21a849b7f0.jpg" /></a></div><br /><i>aka </i><b><i>Mobile matters</i>:</b> having a great user experience on the website is all good and fine. But don&#8217;t make me visit your website at all costs. You can use Facebook to show my friends what I&#8217;m up to, a bookmarket to make it easier to create content, and if you really want to stay competitive in today&#8217;s world, you also have to plan for a great mobile experience. And that is why Pinterest, even though it&#8217;s a pretty fresh service, already has a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinterest/id429047995?mt=8">pretty cool iPhone app</a>. <br /><br />The best thing about the app is the way it lets you focus on content as you scroll down the stream of pins; all unnecessary elements momentarily disappear, so that you don&#8217;t get distracted by what you don&#8217;t need. A great idea that aligns perfects with the purpose of the app and makes the service more accessible. Whether you need your fix of inspiration at home or on the road, Pinterest is there to provide a great service.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The big picture</span></b><br /><br />So, why am I writing about all of this? Yes, partly it is so I can justify all the time spent on Pinterest as &#8220;doing research&#8221;, but mostly because Pinterest (an several other hip startups as well) makes me excited about the future of the web. A future where it will be easier to get around, where content will be increasingly more engaging, and where it won&#8217;t matter which device you&#8217;ll want to use to do your favorite thing; the experience will always be great.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iI-9vICkvgg/TyAJO_pdxaI/AAAAAAAAAJI/mHvpalmpbeY/s1600/pinterest-ialja-boards.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iI-9vICkvgg/TyAJO_pdxaI/AAAAAAAAAJI/mHvpalmpbeY/s1600/pinterest-ialja-boards.jpg" /></a></div><br />And while it might be easy to dismiss Pinterest as a superficial fad with no real value, I think it can be a great discovery tool and a new way for people to communicate and share experiences with one another. Because it is through experiences that we learn best.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;">P.S.: <a href="http://pinterest.com/ialja/"><img alt="Follow Me on Pinterest" height="26" src="http://passets-cdn.pinterest.com/images/follow-on-pinterest-button.png" width="156" /></a> </div></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/01/im-in-love-with-pinterest-and-why-that.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/01/im-in-love-with-pinterest-and-why-that.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<p>I know it&#8217;s super trendy to be anti-Facebook and looking for more &#8220;open&#8221; or less &#8220;evil&#8221; alternatives like Google+ or Diaspora. But after the massive changes announced at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/f8">Facebook&#8217;s f8 developer conference</a> on Thursday, I feel like it&#8217;s time I say this out loud: <b>I love Facebook.</b></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 6px; padding-left: 6px; padding-right: 6px; padding-top: 6px; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOgt-V-8Vhs/Tn4prNgF9qI/AAAAAAAAAIg/M9-C8RchFlg/s1600/facebook-timeline-new-profile.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="259" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOgt-V-8Vhs/Tn4prNgF9qI/AAAAAAAAAIg/M9-C8RchFlg/s400/facebook-timeline-new-profile.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 14px; padding-top: 4px; text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999; font-size: x-small;">Facebook, one of my favorite web destinations<br /></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Skating to where the puck is going to be</span></b><br /><br />I love Facebook as a service, and I love Facebook as a company. I completely agree with MG Siegler from Techcrunch on this: Facebook is becoming the new Apple, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/button-down/">skating to where the puck is going to be</a>, and leaving the competition baffled in dust, miles behind.<br /><br />Sure, change and innovation are often difficult to accept for the now almost 1 billion strong mainstream Facebook user base. Even a minor repositioning of a button is bound to make someone upset. <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/pl/state_web_winter/facebook_layout">For a week or so</a>.<br /><br />And that&#8217;s why I have even more respect for Facebook: despite being very mainstream, they are not afraid to innovate. They could easily sit on their asses for a year or two and wait for Google+ or something else to catch up. Instead, they choose to run head first into the questions nobody is even asking yet, and often finding answers nobody else can think of. Like Apple, Facebook is still able to maintain the mentality of a startup and has the guts to challenge the status quo.<br /><br />Do they get it right every time? No, of course not. But you&#8217;re bound to make mistakes if you&#8217;re trying hard to be the first and the best in what you do. The tricky part is knowing how to recover from your falls, move on, and find the next big thing that will change people&#8217;s lives forever.<br /><br />This might seem like a big statement; after all, Facebook is just a social network, right? Well, it seems like they have bigger plans than that. The folks at Facebook are really hard at work trying to find the best ways for people to connect online. And not by pilling up features, but by rethinking the way we connect to each other on a human level.<br /><br />And <i>human</i> is the keyword to the two major changes announced on Thursday. Firstly, completely redesigned user profiles, now called Timelines. And secondly, the new generation of Facebook apps that enable social experiences, and finally make seem the semantic web a step closer to reality. Let me explain why I&#8217;m so excited about all these new features.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Timelines: not just a profile, but a collection of memories&nbsp;</span></b><br /><br />Let&#8217;s start with&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150289612087131">Timelines</a>. I think it&#8217;s really smart that Facebook decided to give these new profiles a new name. Because it really is a new kind of experience. When the first screenshots were revealed, a lot of people were shouting &#8220;My Space!&#8221;, but it couldn&#8217;t be further from truth. Yes, you do get to choose your own photo to be featured prominently right on top of your Timeline, but what happens below that is… magic.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hzPEPfJHfKU" width="560"></iframe> </div><br />Facebook will be rolling Timelines to users over the next months; a smart move that will give people more time to adjust and to get used to Timelines by seeing them on their friends&#8217; &#8220;profiles&#8221;. If you&#8217;re a developer or willing to pretend to be one with a <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/09/22/how-to-facebook-timeline/">little, easy hack</a>, you can already turn on this feature today, but for now only other developers will be able to see your Timeline (once you&#8217;re ready to publish it). The rest of Facebook users should start seeing the new Timeliness after September 30.<br /><br />Of course, I&#8217;m always in the front row when it comes to trying out new features, so I already enabled mine. Partially, I am writing this blog post so I can justify the hours I already spent exploring and adding stuff to my timeline ;) I think it&#8217;s a beautiful product, and I suspect a lot of people, even those usually reluctant to change, will love it. Because it really feels more human, and establishes emotional connections.<br /><br />Here are the three key things I like about the Timeline so far:<br /><ul><li><b>The ability to add life events, even in the past.</b> It&#8217;s just a beautifully elegant way to keep track of your own life and see what big changes your friends have experienced over the years. And the best part? It&#8217;s super easy to set the privacy for each item, so you can make sure only your friends or perhaps just your family sees certain stories.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DKpcW4bmw2w/Tn4i_Fo860I/AAAAAAAAAIE/IeIUZ0Md98o/s1600/timeline-time-event-cat.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="262" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DKpcW4bmw2w/Tn4i_Fo860I/AAAAAAAAAIE/IeIUZ0Md98o/s400/timeline-time-event-cat.png" width="400" /></a></div></div><ul><li><b>Seeing important personal events and achievements in one place.</b> It&#8217;s like browsing through a personal biography. You can spot trends or opportunities for change, be reminded of precious little moments you almost forgot about. It&#8217;s powerful stuff. And of course, once Timelines go live for everyone, you&#8217;ll be able to create powerful connections with your friends. Discover things that somehow never got mentioned in conversations - of course, only if your friends give you permission to view certain items, it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll automatically gain insight into every aspect of everyone&#8217;s lives!</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EK1jaXTR_sI/Tn4kVvxv--I/AAAAAAAAAIM/dTm3lDaR7Hc/s1600/fb-timeline-memory.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="340" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EK1jaXTR_sI/Tn4kVvxv--I/AAAAAAAAAIM/dTm3lDaR7Hc/s400/fb-timeline-memory.png" width="400" /></a></div><ul><li><b>You&#8217;re control of what is shown, hidden or featured and who gets to see it.</b> Just hover over any item on your timeline and you have the option to Feature it more prominently, Hide it, so it won&#8217;t sneak up on you ever again, check and change the visibility of items and everything else that&#8217;s relevant for an item. It&#8217;s a mission control center even NASA would be proud to have. And it&#8217;s not just for geeks like me; it&#8217;s really easy to use and understand. I think even my cat will use this feature once he figures out how to use my trackpad.</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QHFrqTiJkMs/Tn4jg94NmMI/AAAAAAAAAII/5WSkBM3N88g/s1600/fb-timeline-story-settings.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QHFrqTiJkMs/Tn4jg94NmMI/AAAAAAAAAII/5WSkBM3N88g/s320/fb-timeline-story-settings.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">New generation of Facebook apps: social from inside out, kept in check by smart algorithms</span></b><br /><br />Of course, a new generation of profiles also needs great content. That is why Facebook has also announced big changes to their Open Graph protocol<i>&nbsp;&#8220;to include other actions and objects created by apps and enabling these apps to integrate deeply into the Facebook experience&#8221;</i> (<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/564/">source</a>).<br /><br />Basically, this will enable users to &#8220;read articles&#8221;, &#8220;cook recipes&#8221;, &#8220;do homework&#8221; and what not, instead of just &#8220;liking&#8221; Pages. Using Graph Rank, Facebook will make sure to promote stories based on user activity and engagement. The <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/563/">Facebook Developer Blog</a> provides a great explanation of the kind of things Graph Rank can figure out:<br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;We know people are friends with both their college roommates and their colleagues at work, and those relationships are different. Just because my mom is interested in the movies I am watching doesn&#8217;t mean she is interested in my Github checkins. Graph Rank isn&#8217;t a global score, but a personalized view of you and your friends&#8217; tastes.&#8221;</i></blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/q3b94kFBah8" width="560"></iframe> </div><br />This is very, very powerful stuff. My initial comment to this announcement was: <i>Welcome to the semantic web, courtesy of Facebook.</i> And I&#8217;m sure that announcement had Google engineers biting their nails.<br /><br />Google is of course great at content, but they suck at relationships. And compared to what Facebook just announced, Google+, their latest pride and joy, looks old and irrelevant. Unless, of course, you&#8217;re buying into the whole &#8220;Google is open and free&#8221; propaganda, in which case I strongly recommend reading the recent Guardian article <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/sep/19/android-free-software-stallman">Is Android really free software?</a>.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The Guardian app: a great example of a new social experience</span></b><br /><br />Speaking of Guardian; I would have probably missed that article if it wasn&#8217;t for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2011/sep/22/the-guardian-on-facebook-app">Guardian&#8217;s new Facebook app</a>. It&#8217;s a great place to discover popular articles, and the deep social integration makes it easy to see what your friends are reading. At first glance, the fact that your friends see what you&#8217;re reading may seem scary, but, once again, you have control over that.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GTDUZSCgUH0/Tn4krGg3miI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/FfDAkzPLVRM/s1600/guardian-timeline-news.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="255" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GTDUZSCgUH0/Tn4krGg3miI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/FfDAkzPLVRM/s400/guardian-timeline-news.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999; font-size: x-small;">Recent Activity on my Timeline; I could hide it, but I decided to let my friends see it</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>When you first install this new app, you get a review of the sort of content the app might publish, and you get to decided who can see the automatically shared content. You can make it visible to your friends, just your close friends or even just you (the later choice kinda defeats the whole &#8220;social reading&#8221; concept, but hey! it&#8217;s still there if you want it). And, once you&#8217;re on a story, and don&#8217;t want your friends to see you enjoy reading gossip, you can remove the story from your timeline with just one click.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QCIwOjTY8qI/Tn4l6mq2LJI/AAAAAAAAAIU/xTjEe45jsKQ/s1600/wp-timeline-app-privacy.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QCIwOjTY8qI/Tn4l6mq2LJI/AAAAAAAAAIU/xTjEe45jsKQ/s400/wp-timeline-app-privacy.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999; font-size: x-small;">New dialog box for adding apps with easy to use visibility settings</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Of course, if you still feel like that&#8217;s too much of an invasion, you don&#8217;t have to install the app and keep reading news on the Guardian site on your own, no questions asked. So, the choice is still yours: either you go for the social experience on Facebook or you don&#8217;t and keep consuming the content in the way you always did.<br /><br />Considering the fact that these new features for developers have just been announced, we still have to wait to see the full potential of the new Open Graph. The main thing for me now is the fact that <b>Facebook will be able to filter down the noise from apps much better with these new tools</b>. You won&#8217;t see every &#8220;like&#8221; in the News Feed anymore (the Ticker is now the place for such serendipitous, real-time discovery); instead, your News Feed will focus more on surfacing content that attracts more engagement, which is a great answer to the noise problem.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Simple and easy to use privacy, public subscriptions</span></b><br /><br />And I know most users couldn&#8217;t care less about things like the Open Graph, Graph Rank and other technical mambo jumbo. What they care about is the end result. And Facebook has really made some great improvements in that aspect in the last few weeks leading to the big f8 we just discussed.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, the new Ticker aka stalker box is driving a lot of people insane. Truth be told, it only makes sense when you add the new changes to the app platform to the mix (the addition of &#8220;light stories&#8221; from apps). But the <a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150251867797131">simplification of privacy controls</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150278932602131">Smart Lists</a> are yet another huge thing for Facebook. And while, yet again, people complained when Smart Lists started appearing, I think they&#8217;re brilliantly simple and smart.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r9zv-eQy3C0/Tn4nI-pjunI/AAAAAAAAAIY/rI-bdwso8Vc/s1600/facebook-privacy-controls.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="227" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r9zv-eQy3C0/Tn4nI-pjunI/AAAAAAAAAIY/rI-bdwso8Vc/s400/facebook-privacy-controls.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999; font-size: x-small;"><i>It&#8217;s easy to define the visibility of your content with Smart Lists</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table>So simple, in fact, that both my husband and I were rather shocked to notice his mom (whom you couldn&#8217;t really describe as tech savvy) posting content to her Family smart list, even though we&#8217;ve had a private family group set up for a while now. I don&#8217;t like to put too much weight on anecdotal evidence, but if smart lists make more sense to my mom-in-law than the new groups, Facebook apparently is onto something.<br /><br />And finally, I also love the fact that Facebook now has a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150280039742131">Subscribe button</a>, which allows you to follow public updates of people without friending them. Kinda like on Twitter. I generally don&#8217;t add people I don&#8217;t know in some way or another as my Facebook friends, but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ialja">I welcome all new subscribers</a>.&nbsp;Actually, this new feature encouraged me to start posting most content as public. After all, it&#8217;s the kind of content I&#8217;ve already been posting publicly on Twitter; Facebook just allows me to add longer comments.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rghufKtUQp0/Tn4nPGbC2oI/AAAAAAAAAIc/Y4jRl8CHznw/s1600/facebook-subscribe-button.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rghufKtUQp0/Tn4nPGbC2oI/AAAAAAAAAIc/Y4jRl8CHznw/s1600/facebook-subscribe-button.png" /></a></div><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Facebook as the next big platform: will it make desktop and mobile operating systems irrelevant?</span></b><br /><br />If you&#8217;re following rumors on tech blogs, you probably know all of this is just the tip of the iceberg for Facebook. We&#8217;re all holding our breaths for the release of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/facebook-project-spartan/">Project Spartan</a>, Facebook&#8217;s HTML5 app platform that will supposedly support both <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/19/project-spartan-f8/">mobile and desktop browsers</a>. In other words, no need for an app store when you can just launch Facebook.<br /><br />And, combining recent f8 announcements and what we know about Project Spartan, it&#8217;s now easy to see that Facebook is doing something huge. Not just simplifying and humanizing the existing experience, but building the next big platform. And with those kind of plans, it&#8217;s not so difficult to imagine a future in which the desktop or mobile operating system is just a pretty frame around the bigger picture on your wall. I certainly think Facebook&#8217;s plans are ambitious enough to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apple-2011-9">make Apple nervous</a>.&nbsp;And great competition is always great for innovation. <br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/09/facebook-is-becoming-next-big-platform.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/09/facebook-is-becoming-next-big-platform.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday I came across a <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/08/11/subjot-a-twitter-alternative-that-lets-you-curate-content/">blog post on TNW</a> on <a href="http://subjot.com/"><b>Subjot</b></a>, a Twitter alternative. Yeah, I know. At first, I rolled my eyes. (Yet) another Twitter is probably not what we need. But I&#8217;m glad I read the post anyway and discovered that Subjot actually offers a solution to a Twitter dilemma I&#8217;ve been having lately and builds an interesting product centered around discussion on top of it.<p>I wouldn&#8217;t really call Subjot a Twitter alternative. It actually works quite well with Twitter, and in a way provides a middle way between Twitter and Facebook, providing a public space for discussions based around topics user define themselves. Call me crazy, but I actually see Subjot as Google+ done right. Intrigued? I sure do hope so, because I think Subjot is a nice little gem with a lot of potential and a harbinger of a larger trend. Let me explain why.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HJuByKNjFvk/TkVpkxG9MvI/AAAAAAAAAHY/F-KKCIMbnHA/s1600/subjot-splash.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HJuByKNjFvk/TkVpkxG9MvI/AAAAAAAAAHY/F-KKCIMbnHA/s1600/subjot-splash.png" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr style="color: #999999;"><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Subjot: &#8220;Talk about your favorite subjects. Let your friends choose what to follow.&#8221;</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table><a name='more'></a><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>The human flaw behind Google+ Circles</b></div><br />Ok, first, let&#8217;s get the <a href="https://plus.google.com/">Google+</a> elephant out of the room. Here&#8217;s a confession: I don&#8217;t like Google+. Yes, it&#8217;s new, it&#8217;s shiny, it has a neat interface, and has the privilege to sit on top of all Google services we love and use often. I was thinking about writing a blog post about Google+, but these two blog posts describe what bothers me about it more eloquently than I could:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://kevnull.com/2011/07/can-we-ever-digitally-organize-our-friends.html"><b>Can We Ever Digitally Organize Our Friends?</b></a>: the post does a great job at explaining what Google+ Circles (and grouping friends in general) do right and why they suck. Spoiler alert: we&#8217;re not really good at categorizing people in groups, and every worse at maintaining the categorization; the lines are often too blurry.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/dont-believe-the-hype-2011-07"><b>Reality Check: Google Plus Is No Facebook Or Twitter Killer</b></a>: nice explanation of the problem sharing with Circles creates. Spoiler alert: again, we&#8217;re really bad at deciding what other people are interested in.</li>
 </ul>It&#8217;s not that I think Google+ doesn&#8217;t have potential. It sure does. And Google is very serious about it, so I think that&#8217;s a rare social Google product we&#8217;ll have to learn how to live with. I don&#8217;t think it will kill Facebook; in fact, I see it as a closer threat to Twitter. But unless the majority of friends I interact with the most on Twitter and Facebook ditch Twitter/FB in favor of Google+, I really don&#8217;t see myself actively using it.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Subjot&#8217;s selling point: you get to decide which subjects you want to follow</b></div><br />Now, back to <a href="http://subjot.com/"><b>Subjot</b></a>. The main idea behind Subjot that makes it unique is that we all have different interests we like to talk about. For instance, I&#8217;m interested in education, mobile technologies, running and cats, just to name a few subjects.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x3PtW_4pPP4/TkVz0gzBWMI/AAAAAAAAAH0/mxi5T38P-mU/s1600/ialja-interests-instagram.001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x3PtW_4pPP4/TkVz0gzBWMI/AAAAAAAAAH0/mxi5T38P-mU/s1600/ialja-interests-instagram.001.jpg" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">A few of my interests - and you probably don&#8217;t want to read about all of them </i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table>Now, when a person follows me on Twitter or friends me on Facebook, she will get my updates on all of these subjects. But my dear follow just might be a dog person that doesn&#8217;t think my cat is special (gasp!), which might lead her to unfollow/unfriend me because of my annoying cat updates.<br /><br />Yes, Google+ is built around the idea that you share content only with a circle of friends that will find certain content interesting. The problem is that I don&#8217;t always know who out of my friends likes cats. Meaning, some of my friends might end up missing important updates on my&nbsp;awesome&nbsp;cat! (terrible thought, I know)<br /><br />And this is where Subjot finally comes into the picture: on Subjot, my followers decide which of my subjects they want to follow. Each jot I share has a subject. And if some of my followers are fellow runners, they can follow just the updates about running. If they are interested in social media, they can follow just my updates on social media and ignore all cat posts (although, to be honest, cute cats have always been a big part of social media!).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3NnQEUhXH78/TkVuLUuAtrI/AAAAAAAAAHg/fWriEmJf580/s1600/subjot-follow-options.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="227" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3NnQEUhXH78/TkVuLUuAtrI/AAAAAAAAAHg/fWriEmJf580/s320/subjot-follow-options.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">Your feed, you get to decide which updates you want to get. There are a lot of different follow options for each person you want to keep an eye on.</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Subjot subjects are not just (hash)tags </b></div><br />I know what you might be thinking: it&#8217;s like using hashtags on Twitter or tagging your blogs posts. Well, yes and no. For one, Twitter doesn&#8217;t let you filter your friends&#8217; content by hashtags. If a person you follow tweets excitedly about a conference you&#8217;re not attending, your feed gets really noisy and there&#8217;s nothing you can do unless you unfollow your friend temporarily (rude, I know!). <br /><br />And while you can use several hashtags on Twitter and on your blog, Subjot only has one subject per update. And I think that&#8217;s brilliant because it keeps the service simple. You don&#8217;t have to understand tagging to categorize content on Subjot. Just pick a subject, it&#8217;s that easy!<br /><br />Plus, the user interface for choosing subjects is pretty<i></i> smart. You are always offered the three most common subjects you use in the form of nice, big buttons, and an autocomplete tool helps you reuse subjects you or your friends have already used.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BXorGbNOORM/TkVu8y468FI/AAAAAAAAAHk/WSCpVIfqo9A/s1600/subjot-choosing-subject.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BXorGbNOORM/TkVu8y468FI/AAAAAAAAAHk/WSCpVIfqo9A/s1600/subjot-choosing-subject.png" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">Choosing a subject on Subjot - so easy, my cat could do it</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table>&nbsp;And you can also Explore popular subjects on Subjot and find users that job about certain subjects to follow. Again, you don&#8217;t have to follow everything they post, just the subjects you&#8217;re interested in.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Encouraging discussion with comments and notifications</b></div><br />So, is Subjot just Twitter with the ability to categorize content and fine-tune areas of interest you follow? Luckily, no. Twitter is all about fast, instant sharing - and it&#8217;s really, really good at that! What it&#8217;s not so good at, is keeping track of discussions. You can RT and reply to tweets, of course, but those actions are usually relevant just in that instant.<br /><br />On the other hand, Subjot borrows two very important features from the Facebook side of the fence: the ability to comment on shared content and notification about other people&#8217;s comments. Consequently, Subjot offers a really nice, public space for discussion.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jvAj0PR0cio/TkVvne7qcwI/AAAAAAAAAHo/8i6g1U3heI8/s1600/subjot-comments.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jvAj0PR0cio/TkVvne7qcwI/AAAAAAAAAHo/8i6g1U3heI8/s1600/subjot-comments.png" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">Example of a jot with comments</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Bridging the gap between Twitter and Facebook with elegant simplicity</b></div><br />Yes, unlike Facebook, where a lot of people choose to have private profiles, Subjot in a public discussion place. Here, again, it comes closer to Twitter, where most sharing is public. So, we can describe Subjot as both as Twitter with better support for discussions or as a public Facebook with asynchronous connections (you don&#8217;t have to follow people who follow you). And that&#8217;s the beauty of it.<br /><br />Subjot is not trying to replace either Twitter or Facebook. In fact, it plays nice with both. Whenever you post of Subjot, you can send your updates to Twitter or Facebook or both. And you can easily find friends on Subjot by connecting your Twitter and Facebook accounts.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZjLogAdOpn4/TkVxVkoNp7I/AAAAAAAAAHw/nQMcQH_ehn4/s1600/subjot-add-Twitter-Facebook.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZjLogAdOpn4/TkVxVkoNp7I/AAAAAAAAAHw/nQMcQH_ehn4/s1600/subjot-add-Twitter-Facebook.png" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">You can share your jots on Twitter and/or Facebook</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table>I also like the fact that the creators didn&#8217;t try to cram too many features in the service right from the start. For instance, there are yet no &#8220;Likes&#8221;, reposts, special privacy settings. And in a way that  is ok. I think that at this stage, it&#8217;s smart to let the users figure out how and what they want to use Subjot for. <br /><br />What intrigues me about Subjot is that it isn&#8217;t really trying to clone any of the big, existing social networks, but it&#8217;s providing a fresh, simple, elegant twist on the way we discuss our interests online. Of course, the big challenge for this little gem is attracting enough users that will (hopefully) start forming passionate communities around subjects.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Subjot&#8217;s potential as a discussion platform and the question of privacy</b></div><br />And I do think there is a lot of potential for different types of communities to embrace Subjot. For instance, I can see Subjot being used in education, with teachers and students sharing course related content with the ability to follow just that content and not get updates about their teacher&#8217;s cooking recipes (unless they want to).<br /><br />Of course, as we start to imagine such use cases, the question of privacy also emerges and it&#8217;s one that Subjot hasn&#8217;t addressed yet. For instance, it might be interesting to have the ability to have private subjects and allow followers to view post on those subjects only after approval or upon invitation.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&nbsp;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SHglCyUzpaA/TkV3BnemtZI/AAAAAAAAAH4/hK_kO612prY/s1600/conversation.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SHglCyUzpaA/TkV3BnemtZI/AAAAAAAAAH4/hK_kO612prY/s1600/conversation.jpg" /></a></div>Perhaps there&#8217;s also a monetization opportunity in there - go pro and create unlimited private rooms for certain subjects? Ads and sponsored content could also be interesting opportunity for Subjot down the road. But of course, growing the user base and keeping a close eye on how users are using Subjot should be the main priority in the early stages of the product.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>The big picture: can the Subjot approach cut down the social networking noise?</b></div><br />I think it&#8217;s pretty clear by now that there is something about Subjot that really excites me. I really think Subjot is onto something with this idea of allowing users to follow specific areas of interests when they choose to follow certain people. Of course, we yet have to see how the Subjot approach scales up, but I think a few things are pretty clear by now.<br /><br />First, we all have different interests we like to talk about, and usually our friends don&#8217;t share <i>all</i> our interests with us. Second, there is a need to cut down the noise in social networks. Third, we are not so good at predicting what are friends are interested in and neither are machines (yet). Is the Subjot approach a good solution for all of this? I don&#8217;t know, maybe it is.<br /><br />But I certainly think we&#8217;ll start seeing more and more social networks trying to cut down the noise by filtering content based on users&#8217; interests. For instance, just recently, Facebook started experimenting with the aggregation of news feed stories by topic. Isn&#8217;t the next logical step in this story &#8221;<i>More about topic X&#8221;</i> and <i>&#8220;Less about topic Y&#8221;</i>? Not to mention the increasing number of iPad news app that are trying to figure out what content you like and serve you a highly personalized selection of content based on your friends and behavior.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
 <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EfXCrQvA78Q/TkVwGCMsi5I/AAAAAAAAAHs/M02XGyOT3DE/s1600/Facebook-aggregated-posts-by-topic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EfXCrQvA78Q/TkVwGCMsi5I/AAAAAAAAAHs/M02XGyOT3DE/s1600/Facebook-aggregated-posts-by-topic.jpg" /></a></td></tr>
 <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i style="color: #999999;">Facebook is trying to get smart by grouping news feed posts by topic</i></td></tr>
 </tbody></table>&nbsp;We&#8217;ll see who does a better job at filtering content - humans (on Subjot or even Google+) or smart algorithms (on Facebook and all those fancy news apps). But it&#8217;s certainly something that will be an important competitive advantage in the coming years. After all, I don&#8217;t hear anybody complaining about there not being enough content online, but you can hear a lot of complaints about social networks being too noisy and good content hard to find.<br /><br /><div style="color: #e69138;"><b>Still with me? Good, now give Subjot a try!</b></div><br />Anyhow, thanks for bearing with me through this ridiculously long post. If you did, I do hope you&#8217;re now ready to give Subjot a try. If you want to connect with me there, just sign up using this link: <a href="http://sjot.it/qwwPUQ">http://sjot.it/qwwPUQ</a>.&nbsp;I really do think that Subjot deserves a fair chance, and I&#8217;m really interested in seeing the direction and shape it will take in the future.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/08/subjot-bridging-gap-between-twitter-and.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/08/subjot-bridging-gap-between-twitter-and.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The mission: find a new home for my online hub</span></b><br /><br />Not long after Steve Jobs announced <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>, a free service that would replace (and, quite honestly, dramatically enhance) the existing paid <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/transition.html">MobileMe service</a>, it was clear that those of us that were using MobileMe to host our iWeb website <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/12/rumor-steve-jobs-iweb-mobileme/">would have to look for a new home</a>.<br /><br />Which, for me, meant looking for alternatives for hosting my online hub @ <a href="http://ialja.com/">iAlja.com</a>. Until recently, my online hub was a simple iWeb website that pointed to all my profiles around the web that I&#8217;m using actively, and had a few extra pages for an extended bio and featured work. Nothing complicated, and I liked it that way.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sadooByLa-I/TiWeAwIHOfI/AAAAAAAAAHE/zjnM64SEamo/s1600/ialja-iweb-website.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sadooByLa-I/TiWeAwIHOfI/AAAAAAAAAHE/zjnM64SEamo/s400/ialja-iweb-website.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Goodbye, old iWeb website!</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>But apparently time had come to find a new home for my online hub; a journey, which ended up on Tumblr. So, read on if you want to know why I chose Tumblr and how I&#8217;m using this micro-blogging platform as my personal website.</p><a name='more'></a><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Comparing alternatives for a personal online hub&nbsp;</span></b><br /><br />I started my journey with relatively simple requirements. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of content, so I didn&#8217;t need a complex CMS behind the website. I could have just transferred the website to different host, but I also wanted a simple way to edit the content whenever it was needed, without having to deal with HTML files and FTP upload.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-20_Tj4TomY8/TiXMvVsR1BI/AAAAAAAAAHU/oxM5W1Z0zSQ/s1600/website-alternatives.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-20_Tj4TomY8/TiXMvVsR1BI/AAAAAAAAAHU/oxM5W1Z0zSQ/s1600/website-alternatives.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><i>So many different &nbsp;options&#8230; which one to choose?</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table>At first I considered transferring everything to a hosted <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress blog</a> and purchase extra options such as the ability to use my own domain name, customs designs etc. But that seemed like an overkill, considering that I wouldn&#8217;t be using most of the features of a system like WordPress. I already have my main blog on Blogger, and I like it just the way it is.<br /><br />And yes, I could have just added a few extra pages to this <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> blog and use my domain to point directly to this blog, but I wanted to keep it as a separate place. After all, it already has several links pointing to its content (or so I like to think ;)), so I didn&#8217;t want to fix what wasn&#8217;t broken.<br /><br />I also didn&#8217;t want my domain to point to a profile on a social network, even though <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/11/how-to-build-an-audience-on-the-internet-the-kevin-rose-school-vs-the-fred-wilson-school/">I hear it&#8217;s fashionable</a> to direct your domain to <b>Google+</b> these days. Partly because I&#8217;m not a fan of Google+ yet, but mainly because I still wanted a more unique look and more flexibility when it comes to the content, design and layout of my hub.<br /><br />The next option I looked at were simple to use web builders, such as <a href="http://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> or <a href="http://www.moonfruit.com/">Moonfruit</a>. Both offer a simple web editor and the premium upgrade options for using your own domain and other goodies. I actually started recreating my old website in Weebly, but I felt the editor was a bit too limited (compared to the flexibility I was used to in iWeb), and I didn&#8217;t really like any of the templates.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Revisiting Tumblr as a personal website</span></b><br /><br />Then, finally, I decided to have a closer look at <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, a minimalistic blogging platform that has been getting a lot of attention lately. I&#8217;ve had a Tumblr blog (ialja.tumblr.com) since January 2009 and I occasionally used it to share different types of content. I&#8217;ve always liked it because it was simple to use and allowed me to share smaller bites of content that were&#8217;t full sized blog posts, but yet I could share more in a Tumblr post than I can on Twitter.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OqUvRM-TH5M/TiWduOqx_qI/AAAAAAAAAHA/c7QOUmuTSQ8/s1600/tumblr-post.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="91" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OqUvRM-TH5M/TiWduOqx_qI/AAAAAAAAAHA/c7QOUmuTSQ8/s400/tumblr-post.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I&#8217;ve read people were using Tumblr as their personal websites, so I was curious to see what I could turn my existing Tumblr blog into. I know I could add static pages to the blog, but was there a way to make the blog look less like a blog and more like an online hub? In other words, was there a way to display some static content right on the first page without the latest post getting all the attention?<br /><br />As it turn out, the answer was yes. You just have to find the right theme.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Tumblr&#8217;s secret sauce: powerful, great looking themes</span></b><br /><br />Tumblr has many great features that are making it <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/15/tumblr-surpasses-wordpress/">increasingly popular</a>, such as&nbsp;the simple, yet powerful editor for content of different types and the dashboard that makes it really easy to reshare, like and follow content posted by members of the Tumblr community. But one of my personal favorite features of Tumblr is the rich <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/">Theme Garden</a>, which features all sorts of&nbsp;amazing looking themes.<br /><br />Tumblr themes aren&#8217;t just pretty to look at, but can also help you to use Tumblr for different purposes. There are themes for designers/photographers that can turn Tumblr into a <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-10-free-tumblr-themes-create-portfolio/">portfolio</a>, professional looking themes for <a href="http://www.sparkplugdigital.com/blog/an-introduction-to-tumblr-for-business/">business websites</a> and much more. And here&#8217;s the best part: you can get a lot of great looking themes for free!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ES09_CAkQk/TiXKFJUqpvI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/L0hB8HDndC0/s1600/tumblr-themes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="323" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ES09_CAkQk/TiXKFJUqpvI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/L0hB8HDndC0/s400/tumblr-themes.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">A few examples of Tumblr themes</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Ok, I confess: I spent quite a few hours browsing through different themes in the Theme Garden and on different websites. I&#8217;ve never imagined I&#8217;d have so much fun playing virtual dress up with my blog! But there&#8217;s also another thing you should take into consideration when choosing your Tumblr theme: the customization and advanced options it provides.<br /><br />For instance, I was looking for a theme that would let me choose custom colors for links and titles, had the ability to easily add Disqus for comments, and my Google Analytics tracking ID. Yes, you can also do all that by fiddling with custom HTML, but why bother if you can find an awesome theme that does all that work for you?<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The Single A Tumblr Theme: sticky post, featured tag and more</span></b><br /><br />Well, lo and behold, at the end I ended up finding the perfect theme for just what I was looking for. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://singleatheme.tumblr.com/">Single A Theme</a>, it&#8217;s free (!), and provides some features that I haven&#8217;t found in any other Tumblr theme and lots of cool customization options. The key feature of this theme is certainly the ability to have a sticky post at the top of the blog - perfect for an online hub!<br /><br />So, here&#8217;s how my online hub <a href="http://ialja.com/">iAlja.com</a> looks now with this great theme:<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KKWPUqBtHEE/TiWe09gToQI/AAAAAAAAAHI/0qxTMiSrF90/s1600/ialja-new-website.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="302" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KKWPUqBtHEE/TiWe09gToQI/AAAAAAAAAHI/0qxTMiSrF90/s400/ialja-new-website.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">New, simple look for my online hub&nbsp;</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>It&#8217;s simple, it has just the colors I wanted, and it works. I&#8217;m using the sticky post feature of the theme to display an intro text with all the key links at the top, and I also use Tumblr&#8217;s Pages to display static content from my old website (<a href="http://ialja.com/about">About</a>, <a href="http://ialja.com/featured">Featured Work</a>). In addition to that, I&#8217;ve also added a link to this blog in the menu, so it&#8217;s easily accessible from any page.<br /><br />The theme also allows me to display me latest tweets in the sidebar, and I can use the Tumblr blog to post quick thoughts or interesting content I come across. For longer posts, such as this one, I still use my main Blogger blog, and then just post a link to the post on the Tumblr blog.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W0K3m46MTNQ/TiXICE4M1SI/AAAAAAAAAHM/wF5EezYpMoY/s1600/single-a-customization-tumblr.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W0K3m46MTNQ/TiXICE4M1SI/AAAAAAAAAHM/wF5EezYpMoY/s400/single-a-customization-tumblr.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Single A Theme: l</span></i><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">ots of customization options&nbsp;</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Thumbs up for Tumblr!</span></b><br /><br />All in all, I&#8217;m really happy with this solution and with my newly discovered online home. I found Tumblr to be flexible enough, while simple to use. Yes, it might take a little while to find the perfect theme, but once it&#8217;s set up, you can just focus on posting content.<br /><br />It&#8217;s so simple, I even decided to open another Tumblr blog dedicated to <a href="http://runjourney.tumblr.com/">running</a>. The fact that it&#8217;s ok to share bite size content on Tumblr encourages me to share more, and to do it faster, without getting in the way.<br /><br />So, if you&#8217;re looking for a simple way of sharing content that you can make your own with a unique look, and a great community on top of that, Tumblr is definitely the way to go.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Recently I was invited to prepare a guest lecture for a small group of business and management students attending an E-learning course as part of their Summer School in Koper. I was told to choose a topic that would be fresh, something that students don&#8217;t get to hear about that often in regular classes.<br /><p>And that&#8217;s why I decided to put together an <b>overview of some of the key trends in the mobile industry</b> that are already influencing the way we study, work and socialize, and will probably be an increasingly important part of our day to day life. You can find the slides and the video of my lecture, as well as a text recap, in this post.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aUbDxvFBiA/ThYi-IEQddI/AAAAAAAAAG4/JeD6QsZPcPQ/s1600/mobile_trends_lecture-ialja.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aUbDxvFBiA/ThYi-IEQddI/AAAAAAAAAG4/JeD6QsZPcPQ/s1600/mobile_trends_lecture-ialja.jpg" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Lecture slides with additional resources</span></span></b><br /><br />Because choosing just a few trends, just a few technologies wasn&#8217;t easy, I decided to prepare slides that students could also use to explore parts of the lecture they found most interesting in more details. That is why I added a lot of links to current articles with cases studies, stats, analysis and what not. You can view all of the slides embedded below.<br /><div id="__ss_8505250" style="width: 510px;"><strong style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/5-key-mobile-trends-youshould-know-about" target="_blank" title="5 key mobile trends you should know about">5 key mobile trends you&nbsp;should know about</a></strong> <iframe frameborder="0" height="426" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/8505250" width="510"></iframe> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a> </div></div><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Don&#8217;t like flipping through slides? Here&#8217;s a recap.</span></span></b><br /><br />To sum it all up in a more coherent form, here are the 5 key mobile trends I decided to highlight:<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">1. Mobile devices are making learning (and other activities) more magical</span></b><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rdamdLBTkgI/ThYe6jYoreI/AAAAAAAAAGk/uKosOTlfIS0/s1600/magic_touch_apple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rdamdLBTkgI/ThYe6jYoreI/AAAAAAAAAGk/uKosOTlfIS0/s1600/magic_touch_apple.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">The magic of touch (source: </span></span></i><a href="http://www.apple.com/education/"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Apple</span></span></i></a><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">)</span></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Interactive content is nothing new. What is new is the way mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets (that include smart sensors and touch screens) allow us to physically touch the content. It does feel a bit like magic, touching just isn&#8217;t the same as clicking with a mouse. It&#8217;s more intuitive, more personal. It gets to you.<br /><br />And while today apps like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-edAGLokak">Our Choice</a> are often seen as fun gimmicks that you can use to impress an audience, I believe that in a few years we&#8217;ll wonder how we&#8217;ve ever settled for learning with content we couldn&#8217;t touch directly. Ok, make that a couple of more years; we all know most edu folks aren&#8217;t exactly early adopters. But I believe that someday the shift will happen, because touch just feels so natural to all of us. <br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">2. Apps and app stores are rocking the world</span></b><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OrnOm-kUMp8/TXJ1CCZiP3I/AAAAAAAAAs8/qbLafMHHrDE/s1600/iPad-apps.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OrnOm-kUMp8/TXJ1CCZiP3I/AAAAAAAAAs8/qbLafMHHrDE/s1600/iPad-apps.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">The App Store has over 400,000 apps (source: </span></span></i><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Apple</span></span></i></a><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">)</span></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>There certainly is an app and an app store for that - whatever your &#8220;that&#8221; might be. Apart from satisfying our desire to help <a href="http://www.rovio.com/index.php?page=angry-birds">angry birds</a> get revenge on those naughty, egg-stealing pigs, mobile apps (and the development ecosystem Apple envisioned) are teaching everyone some important lessons. There are many reasons why apps are so successful. The most obvious one is because they are just so much more awesome and magical, if you will, than our desktop software.<br /><br />But another very important lesson (one that Apple already learned with the iTunes Store) is that we don&#8217;t mind paying for digital content if it&#8217;s easy and convenient to do so and if the content provides us with enough value. And, on the other side of the fence, we are eager to develop good content  if we get the chance to earn a few bucks and be the coolest kid in town aka the app store of our choice.<br /><br />The application stores are also making business models that rely on selling virtual content (in-app purchases) more popular and widely acceptable. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m stretching it too far if I predict that in a few year we&#8217;ll be spending 99 cents on fancy templates for Microsoft Office. Right within the software, or app, as we&#8217;ll all be calling it by then. One click, ka-ching! Of course, Apple will probably the first one to offer in-app purchases in Pages ;) Which all leads us to the next trend&#8230;<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">3. Website and desktops are changing because of mobile devices</span></b><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RRirp1lvPqg/ThYf5Xo0HkI/AAAAAAAAAGo/eTX6G3Z5d2U/s1600/mac_lion_launchpad.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RRirp1lvPqg/ThYf5Xo0HkI/AAAAAAAAAGo/eTX6G3Z5d2U/s1600/mac_lion_launchpad.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">Apps in Mac OS X - looks familiar, doesn&#8217;t it?

Full screen apps, a new app launcher, the Mac App Store, heavily integrated gestures&#8230; Yep, Apple has learned a lot from iOS, their mobile operating system, and it&#8217;s bringing most&nbsp;of it&nbsp;(including the App Store business models) to their big, desktop OS.<br /><br />And don&#8217;t think this is just an Apple fad - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p92QfWOw88I">Windows 8</a> will also look like Windows Phone 7&#8217;s big brother. It seem like we&#8217;ve got no choice but to adapt to seeing our desktops becoming some sort of clumsier mobile device with a big screen.<br /><br />Not to mention websites also all want to look like apps. And <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/">HTML5</a>, CSS3 &amp; co. will make that all possible. Expect to see more websites that look and behave like apps or at least websites that will be smart enough to have the decency to self adjust to your screen size and even device type. I sure do hope to see more responsive design on the web in the coming years.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">4.

Where to start? It&#8217;s pretty clear that adding location data can make many services more useful and even fun. From local searches that help you discover cool nearby places, to the phenomena of telling all your friends not just what you&#8217;re doing, but also <i>where</i> you&#8217;re doing it and getting specials or offers in return, mobile payments and mobile commerce taking off, geo-fences that enable location reminds, ad-hoc social networks based on location, and&#8230; and&#8230; and&#8230;<br /><br />There is A LOT going on, so I really suggest you take a look at some of those additional links provided in the slide deck above. There&#8217;s no doubt that relying on location data to enhance services is a big trend that is just starting to evolve. As a side note, it is of course also worth noting that we have a lot of open questions about privacy and trust to figure out yet, especially when it comes to sensitive location data.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">5.

The new wave of cloud services from all the big boys are all trying to making it easy for us to access our content, data and files from any of the devices we own.<br /><br />And while most people, who today know very well computers just aren&#8217;t to be trusted, are still skeptical of all these promises (it does look a bit like science fiction, doesn&#8217;t it?), I think in a few years we&#8217;ll all get adjusted to things just working seamlessly through the cloud. <br /><br />And that is probably the master trend to rule them all - the technology is slowly getting out of the way, fading in the background, while allowing us to be the forgetful, spontaneous, touch fixated human beings that we all are. In this world, experience is the killer app. <br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Prefer video to text?
