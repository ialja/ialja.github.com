<a href="/2010/08/7-things-i-love-about-evernote.html" title="/2010/08/7-things-i-love-about-evernote.html">I used to love Evernote</a>. &#8220;Remember everything&#8221; is their headline. People talk about &#8220;outsourcing your memory&#8221; with Evernote. And I did. I made Evernote the hub for most of my work that didn&#8217;t require documents. I stored everything, from meeting notes and blog post drafts to notes about our cats&#8217; health and even kept a shared notebook for our favorite recipes. <br /><p>One of the things I loved most about Evernote was its ability to keep all my notes synced across multiple devices. Sounds great, doesn&#8217;t it? Yeah, except things don&#8217;t &#8220;just work&#8221; anymore. </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OCL2l1Vozc8/UNYA6qqypOI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/E3YhmHfJiBE/s1600/goodbye-evernote.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="215" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OCL2l1Vozc8/UNYA6qqypOI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/E3YhmHfJiBE/s320/goodbye-evernote.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><h2>How Evernote started ruining meetings for me </h2><br />It&#8217;s not a new problem. I first started having problems this Summer. I like to prepare for meetings in advance, so I spent some time jotting down notes in Evernote in the evening. I was a bit of a hurry to get to the meeting the next morning, so I didn&#8217;t bother to press the Sync button on Evernote on my iMac. I&#8217;ve always had automatic syncing on, so I didn&#8217;t really think twice about it.<br /><br />Except I should have. On the bus I took out my iPhone to revise the agenda for the meeting. Tough luck. The note isn&#8217;t there, and neither are all the other notes I knew I created the day before, even a couple of days before! Of course, I have no way to remotely push the Evernote Sync button on my iMac, so I improvise and try to recreate the notes from memory. Luckily I hadn&#8217;t yet completely outsourced my memory to Evernote despite being a Premium user, so I was able to remember most of it.<br /><br /><h2>Do elephants run Evernote support?</h2><br />The first thing I did when I got back home was to check my Evernote settings. Everything was as it should had been, automatic sync every 5 minutes. I try to manually sync, and the notes then appear on my iPhone. Ok, time to contact Evernote support. <br /><br />As a Premium user I did get a response within the business day, but I can&#8217;t say it was very useful. I sent them the activity log and they recommended reinstalling Evernote. No other explanation. Was this a recurring problem? Just a faulty installation? How can I check that the next time? I suggested they implement a sync checker into the app that would actually tell the user automatic syncing has failed. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t really have a habit of checking apps logs when I except the app to just work. In fact, I didn&#8217;t even know Evernote had an Activity Log before I ran into problems.<br /><br /><h2>Evernote works fine if you&#8217;re using just one device</h2><br />Back to my story. Time goes by. I replace my iMac with a MacBook Pro and spend most of the time on the same machine. Meaning, I&#8217;m mostly using Evernote on one device. I still like the idea of being able to access notes from anywhere if I need to. However, the few times I do use the Evernote mobile apps, they display weird sync behavior. I don&#8217;t pay much attention to the issue as I now always have my laptop with me during meetings. So I decide to stick with Evernote for the time being and renew my subscription on December 1.<br /><br />As an Evernote user, I&#8217;m glad to see them release a big update to all their apps this Fall. The mobile one certainly has some nice tricks up its sleeve, like the sync button that&#8217;s now easily accessible on the first screen (yep, that wasn&#8217;t the case before). The Mac app is bloated and takes some time getting used to, but at least I can still access my notes and write them as before. Changes happen, so I don&#8217;t make a big deal out of this.<br /><br />Until yesterday, when I decide to only take my iPad to work. And guess what? I want to look up something in Evernote and notice that all notes from over a week ago are missing. I press the sync button over and over again, on my iPad, on my iPhone. Nope. The notes just aren&#8217;t in the cloud. And that is where my patience ends.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Are regular reinstalls the only way to make Evernote sync?</h2><br />I contact support again, specifically asking them not to serve me with an automated reply like last time. I want to talk to a human that can actually explain what&#8217;s going one. But no, no such luck. Either they have machines answering the tickets or their support staff has very strict guidelines on what they can and cannot write. Meanwhile I&#8217;ve had very good experience with Nike Store support, you can see they are actual humans working there. You know, with emotions and the ability to write unique sentences.<br /><br />Anyhow, the official Evernote answer is that I appear to be running an old version of the app (after sending the ticket the latest update showed up in the Mac App Store) and that I should reinstall Evernote. Same reply I got last time, same instruction on how to reinstall the app (as if that was so difficult on a Mac&#8230;), yet they still haven&#8217;t figured out Evernote now lives in the Mac App Store.<br /><br /><h2>Goodbye Evernote, hello alternatives!</h2><br />Dear Evernote, I just don&#8217;t want to talk to support bots anymore. I don&#8217;t need a bloated app that looks pretty. I want to write notes and have them in sync on all my devices. Which is why <b>I </b><strong>cancelled my Evernote Premium subscription yesterday and started looking for alternatives</strong>.<br /><br />I looked at <a href="http://springpad.com/" title="http://springpad.com/">Springpad</a> - but they have no Mac client. I looked at <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/" title="http://simplenoteapp.com">Simplenote</a> - but apparently they&#8217;ve been having sync issues for a while now as well. And the more I looked, the more I started seeing <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" title="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> mentioned as an alternative! Dropbox? Yeah, you can easily have a folder for Notes, keep them in .txt or .rtf format and edit them practically anywhere. In TextEdit, for instance, which is one of the Apple apps I use most often on my Mac. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jU0z3W5fi8U/UNYE6kSA12I/AAAAAAAAAqw/NGlEn91YDXo/s1600/springpad-simplenote-dropbox-mobile-apps.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="120" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jU0z3W5fi8U/UNYE6kSA12I/AAAAAAAAAqw/NGlEn91YDXo/s400/springpad-simplenote-dropbox-mobile-apps.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />And as I started considering this alternative, I started discovering more and more note taking apps that can sync with Dropbox, even <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/" title="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>. Sure, they don&#8217;t have all the fancy stuff Evernote has, but I rarely use tags after I assign them, and I&#8217;ve only needed audio notes once in the last year. Most of my notes are text notes. I already use <a href="/2012/01/im-in-love-with-pinterest-and-why-that.html">Pinterest for visual bookmarking</a>, and Springpad seems like a really nice complementary service for that. It has a great mobile app and it&#8217;s very easy to have a private collection of more visually based notes and share them with my husband. For free!<br /><br />So, I realize that instead of a full blown alternative to Evernote what I really need is a bloat-free app that enables me to write, has just a few of the basic formatting options (bold, italic, the ability to make links).<br /><br /><h2>I&#8217;m in love with the simplicity of iA Writer</h2><br />And this is where I discover <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/" title="http://www.iawriter.com">iA Writer</a>. Well, discover is not really the right word here. I was aware of the app before, but I thought it was just for fancy writing stuff, a more simple version of Pages. But it turns out it now has both iCloud and Dropbox sync, a gorgeously simple native Mac app and an equally simple iOS client that works for both iPhone and iPad. The runner up was <a href="http://bywordapp.com/" title="http://bywordapp.com">Byword</a>, another simple text editor both for Macs and iOS devices. Both of these apps focus on writing text in an uncluttered way, and both support <a href="http://support.iawriter.com/help/kb/general-questions/markdown-syntax-reference-guide" title="http://support.iawriter.com/help/kb/general-questions/markdown-syntax-reference-guide">Markdown</a> for basic text formatting. And oh, they also make it easier to prepare text for the web, HTML tags and all. Bingo!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/33964031?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="500"></iframe> <br /><a href="http://vimeo.com/33964031">iA Writer now with iCloud</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/ia">Oliver Reichenstein</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><h2>iCloud and Dropbox to the rescue</h2><br />Yeah, I know, I&#8217;m quite biased. All the gadgets I use were designed by Apple in California (and Assembled in China, of course), so I didn&#8217;t blink twice because there&#8217;s no Android or Windows support in either of these apps. However! I did manage to export all my notes from Evernote to Dropbox using <a href="https://www.cloudhq.net/">cloudHQ</a> in .txt format, which means I can access and edit them anywhere. And while I&#8217;ll be using iCloud in iA Writer for notes I am using the most (offline ability tipped the scale), I&#8217;ll keep using Dropbox as a storage/backup tool for less frequently used notes. Spotlight will make sure I can easily find old notes in the Notes folder on my Dropbox.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iEsxNDNvWcA/UNYC-_-VbjI/AAAAAAAAAqg/rz0BvazfO44/s1600/icloud-dropbox.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="130" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iEsxNDNvWcA/UNYC-_-VbjI/AAAAAAAAAqg/rz0BvazfO44/s320/icloud-dropbox.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Sure, the solution might not be as elegant as using Evernote for everything, but iCloud and Dropbox syncing has so far been good to me. And I can use the 40€/year I&#8217;ll be saving for not using Evernote anymore on expanded iCloud storage if I need to (as a legacy MobileMe member I still have more than enough space, but expanding storage might come in handy if I start using iCloud more intensively in various apps).<br /><br /><h2>TL;DR: Evernote, make sure your core functionality works before focusing on the looks!</h2><br />And with that, dear Evernote, I am saying my official goodbyes. I have fond memories of you, we&#8217;ve had some good times together. But I just can&#8217;t watch anymore as your apps get prettier and prettier and your core functionality lies forgotten in the dust. A quick Google search showed I&#8217;m not the only one with this problem. And I&#8217;m just not willing to reinstall your app once in a while to make sure it works properly. I&#8217;m not playing the Evernote lottery (&#8220;Will my notes be synced today?&#8221;) anymore.<br /><br />Mind you, I&#8217;m not complaining about a free service here, I&#8217;m complaining about a service I pay for and it&#8217;s just not working as advertised. Goodbye, Evernote. I am moving on, to more simple (and cheaper) solutions. I&#8217;ll just make sure all notes were migrated properly and then I&#8217;ll gladly uninstall your app from my Mac, as per your instructions, <strong>permanently</strong>.<br /><br /><i><b>Update:</b> Well, one thing Evernote support did right was to refund my account for the yearly subscription. Thanks, I guess, though I would rather have a functional product I was more than happy to pay for.&nbsp;</i><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/i-quit-evernote-why-company-shouldnt.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/i-quit-evernote-why-company-shouldnt.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

What happens when you fill 2 classrooms and 1 big conference room at <a href="http://en.telekom.si/">Telekom Slovenije</a> with over 70 girls of all ages, who want to build their own web app, and 30 coaches, experienced web developers? No, it&#8217;s not a rhetorical question, it&#8217;s a real challenge!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vkCHcmWd2Bg/UM72ZDyLCyI/AAAAAAAAAos/mo_g7PzdImg/s1600/219146_482121458493804_716264997_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vkCHcmWd2Bg/UM72ZDyLCyI/AAAAAAAAAos/mo_g7PzdImg/s400/219146_482121458493804_716264997_o.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Over a hundred people at the first Rails Girls Ljubljana workshop!

But most of them have no experience with programming whatsoever. And the coaches sure are all excited to help and hope to see more girls among their ranks, yet most of them have little or no experience with teaching, especially with teaching complete beginners. Even after more than a month of intensive planning, countless emails and meetings, I, as the main organizer, can&#8217;t help but feel nervous on Friday, December 14, the first day of the first ever Rails Girls Ljubljana. Is anyone even going to show up?<br /><a name='more'></a><br />The doubts and worries dissipate once I see all those smiling faces. Once I see the coaches interacting with the girls. Patiently answering all questions, making sure <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/">everything is installed</a> successfully and ready to go for the workshop. You can feel the excitement and positive energy in the air!<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">3,2,1&#8230; in gremooooo, punce! <a href="http://t.co/zIPk6WPi" title="http://twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/status/279636337550843905/photo/1">twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/…</a><br />— RailsGirls Ljubljana (@RailsGirls_LJ) <a data-datetime="2012-12-14T17:17:53+00:00" href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/status/279636337550843905">December 14, 2012</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />The next day, Saturday, December 15, I wake up an hour before the alarm goes off. My mind keeps running through the to-dos, making last minute plans. The nervousness has already been replaced by excitement. Fueled by the positive energy of the day before, I can&#8217;t wait to welcome the participants in the morning. A lot of them arrive early, also eager to start and get the first dose of coffee.<br /><br />After breakfast we start by welcoming everybody, but I try to keep the intro short. I can&#8217;t wait to hear our motivational talks by two great girl geeks. <a href="https://twitter.com/sparkica">Mateja</a> tells them about how programming will probably make them feel like Alice in Wonderland, but also highlights the thrill of programming, the joy of <i>creating</i> something on your own out of code. Dunja then takes over to remind us of the rich history of women in programming. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bEur79eYw4o/UM74edH3lDI/AAAAAAAAAo8/g2og-6GANgY/s1600/316607_482120485160568_1640987580_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bEur79eYw4o/UM74edH3lDI/AAAAAAAAAo8/g2og-6GANgY/s400/316607_482120485160568_1640987580_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Hana making sure our motivational talks get recorded!&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Both talks make a great introduction to the practical part of the day. I first explain how the internet works and what we&#8217;ll be doing during the workshop using <a href="/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html">Octocat, sushi and sushi chefs</a>. The smiles on the girls&#8217; faces are a good sign, although I also see some traces of doubts &#8220;Will I really be able to do that?&#8221;.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmXneBGpD14/UM73Ycmo3rI/AAAAAAAAAo0/Njx-IX_4akI/s1600/68657_482120785160538_711443265_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="399" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmXneBGpD14/UM73Ycmo3rI/AAAAAAAAAo0/Njx-IX_4akI/s400/68657_482120785160538_711443265_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Explaining objects and methods with a lot of waving around :) Photo by: <a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a>&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We play with <a href="http://tryruby.org/">TryRuby.org</a> a bit and then learn how to Google everything with the <a href="http://blog.railsgirls.com/post/20405930015/bentobox-learn-the-language-of-technology">Bento Box exercise</a>. But that&#8217;s just about enough theory, the girls want to get their own hands dirty with code!

I hear girls and coaches talking abut their apps while waiting in line. The girls seem especially eager to finish fast and get back to their code!<br /><br />Food obviously makes us all a bit sleepy, so we guide everyone outside for a good dose of fresh air, a quick stretch and we finally do our <a href="http://fridayhug.com/">#FridayHug</a> group shot.

It doesn&#8217;t take long for some groups to reach the &#8220;What&#8217;s Next?&#8221; part of the guide. Before the workshop is over, some have already added comments, ratings, deployed their app online with Heroku, some are playing with CSS or working on special assignments their coaches gave them. By 6 PM everyone has their own web app. We are all tired, but happy and excited.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>One of challenges of organizing <a href="http://railsgirls.com/ljubljana">Rails Girls Ljubljana</a> was coming up with short lectures that would prepare the girls, absolute beginners, to understand the basic terminology of the web and what they would be working on.</p>Sure, there are some existing presentations online about what programming is and where Rails fits in the whole story, but I thought beginners could benefit from something a bit more simple, funny and thus memorable. Which is why I borrowed <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>&#8217;s mascot <a href="http://octodex.github.com/">Octocat</a> and sent him off on a journey to find sushi without fish on the web. Wait, what?<br /><a name='more'></a><br />Have a look for yourself, here are the slides, both in English and Slovenian (the original I used for my lecture):<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15661527" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="512"> </iframe> <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/the-web-and-programming-an-introduction-simple-short-and-friendly" target="_blank" title="The web and programming: an introduction - Simple, short and friendly ">The web and programming: an introduction - Simple, short and friendly </a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15661515" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="512"> </iframe> <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/uvod-v-internet-in-programiranje-enostavno-kratko-in-prijazno" target="_blank" title="Uvod v internet in programiranje: Enostavno, kratko in prijazno">Uvod v internet in programiranje: Enostavno, kratko in prijazno</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div><br />In case you find the slides useful, the main tip for presenting with them is: don&#8217;t explain everything on the slides, focus on the story. In the first part, where I introduce the client-server model of the web, I didn&#8217;t explain the technical terms too much. I compared IP addresses to phone numbers servers have and DNS servers to a phonebook. I do think it&#8217;s good for beginners to be eposed to these terms, but they don&#8217;t really need to know in detail what they mean.<br /><br />When talking about GET requests, I didn&#8217;t explain HTTP or the format of a request. A GET request is all they need to hear, and you can mention that sometimes the server doesn&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for in which case you get and <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/60-really-cool-and-creative-error-404-pages/">Error 404 page</a>. But if the server does find the web page, it sends it in HTML to your browser. Knowing all the steps will make it easier for people tounderstand that there are many steps involved into the process and that fast loading pages can only happen if all part of the process work as they are supposed to.<br /><br />In the second part I explained the different between a static and a dynamic web page using Octocat, who doesn&#8217;t quite want the usual sushi. I explained the concept of a web app with the sushi chef living on the server, ready to tailor the content (or looks) of the web pages to each user&#8217;s needs and interests, just like Facebook. And once you have a sushi chef, it&#8217;s easy to explain Ruby as the language you need to learn to make the chef (the web app) do what you want.<br /><br />Simple, short, friendly and apparently memorable: one of the participants was just asking me about Octocat and sushi on Twitter, so I guess a different approach did the trick!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" /></a></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Simple concept, simple instructions. Write 750 words. And come back again tomorrow, write at least 750 more. Rinse and repeat. 750 words. Each and every day in the past year. Now a total of 356,548 words, 367 days.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8VLtGvzcrxY/ULCkYKFYDlI/AAAAAAAAAm0/xPGrElhDOJI/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-11-24+at+10.55.48.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8VLtGvzcrxY/ULCkYKFYDlI/AAAAAAAAAm0/xPGrElhDOJI/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-11-24+at+10.55.48.png" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><br />Celebrating the one year anniversary of my 750 words habit makes me look back at the year that is now coming to an end. It certainly has been an interesting one. The health part of the equation wasn&#8217;t all that good for me, especially due to annoying <a href="http://runjourney.tumblr.com/post/34045812473/have-i-given-up-on-my-running-journey">running injuries</a> I&#8217;m still recovering from. Yet on the other side of the equation I got some really great new work opportunities and challenges that make it easier to get out of bed in the morning. Twice a week now I even make myself jump out of bed, feed the cats, get dressed in my running gear, and finish my morning run before 8 AM, so I have the rest of the day &#8220;free&#8221;. Free meaning being able to work without distractions.<br /><br />On those excitingly busy days my morning ritual also involves writing at least 750 words a day. In sickness, in health. Whether I feel inspired and write really great stuff, sometimes even a thousand words at a time, or whether I feel completely empty headed and just go with the flow. Often I can&#8217;t think of anything smart to say and I just write about my day. Journal mode, I call it. But even by doing that I often uncover the unexpected.&nbsp;When you can&#8217;t stop before reaching 750 words, you have to dig deeper into yourself and often stumble upon buried treasure or skeletons.<br /><br />I guess that&#8217;s one of the things I like most about the 750 words challenge. When I start writing, I rarely know how the story is going to end. Sometimes the trail I follow is a straight line, but more often than not the trail takes scenic detours into strange lands. Another interesting thing is the fact that the website provides stats about the style and content of your writing. It shows your mood, your attitude towards the world. For instance, my level of Happy is above the world average, especially in recent times. I also seem less focused on the past than others, more on the present.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1yk7I4YEK_c/ULCeo8CEVhI/AAAAAAAAAl0/0j4gUmasBPE/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-11-24+at+10.56.09.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="196" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1yk7I4YEK_c/ULCeo8CEVhI/AAAAAAAAAl0/0j4gUmasBPE/s400/Screen+Shot+2012-11-24+at+10.56.09.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: x-small;">I seem to be having plenty of &#8220;Happy&#8221; recently!</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--BjB5WVhs-Y/ULCepOcgc5I/AAAAAAAAAmA/rnUXeJlTSE0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-11-24+at+10.57.07.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--BjB5WVhs-Y/ULCepOcgc5I/AAAAAAAAAmA/rnUXeJlTSE0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-11-24+at+10.57.07.png" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: x-small;">Living in the present, recently writing about the future</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />Writing at least 750 words every day, just for the sake of it, has also made me a better writer. Most of what I do for a living involves writing, so that&#8217;s a pretty big deal to me. But I never use my 750 words for job related writing. No, the time spent on the website is my time for practice.&nbsp;Writing without a specific goal in mind about anything in the world can do wonders.&nbsp;I no longer put off the most annoying phase of writing - the beginning. I can now sit down, start jotting down thoughts until it all starts coming together. You can always edit stuff later. The important thing is to start.<br /><br />I have to admit that when I was just starting out, the badges for different achievements were a great motivational tool. Sure, I was still happy to become one of the 239 people with a Pegasus badge for 365 consecutive days of writing. But it&#8217;s not really about that anymore. My now 367 days long streak of writing is a living proof of my determination, of my strength. It might not sound like much, but making time (at least 11 minutes) for writing every single day is not always easy. The key part being <i>every single day</i>. I wrote while being sick in bed, barely able to keep my eyes open. I wrote on insanely busy days or insanely great days when I&#8217;d rather not sit behind the computer. In the sun, in the rain, during storms, I wrote. And the result of that really can&#8217;t be measured in badges. It&#8217;s just priceless.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OmqjRNPYvWk/ULCenlw0B4I/AAAAAAAAAlo/o6wyQfpezyo/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-11-24+at+10.55.11.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OmqjRNPYvWk/ULCenlw0B4I/AAAAAAAAAlo/o6wyQfpezyo/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-11-24+at+10.55.11.png" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="color: #cccccc;">750words.com badges I have earned many, but that&#8217;s not really the point anymore</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><br />And while writing every day isn&#8217;t for everyone, I would encourage everyone to try doing something like this for a year. Whether it&#8217;s taking 10 minutes in the morning or evening for meditation. Or 10 minutes for making and drinking tea. Whatever you like. Pick one thing and try to make a new habit out of it. It will end up making you a better, stronger person, in one way or another. And even if you fail along the way, break your streak, don&#8217;t give up. You can always start again.<br /><br />Thank you, 750words, thank you for making me a better writer and a better person! And don&#8217;t worry, this isn&#8217;t a goodbye, this is just a toast. After all, there&#8217;s this 500 days badge (Space Bird!) still waiting to be conquered. Now that&#8217;s just 133 days away. Nothing compared to the 367 I already completed. Although, to be completely honest, it doesn&#8217;t really get that much easier. Every day is still a struggle on its own, but with every day I add to the streak, it seems more foolish to just give up. Who knows, maybe I can even reach a 750 days streak of 750 words? There&#8217;s no badge for that (yet), but that would still be a pretty sweet achievement.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/11/why-i-write-at-least-750-words-day.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/11/why-i-write-at-least-750-words-day.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html">The Game of Thrones TV series</a> gave me a much needed kick in the ass to start reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a> series of fantasy novels by <a href="http://georgerrmartin.com/">George R. R. Martin</a>. Again. I actually read the first book or two a couple years ago, around the time when the fourth book was coming out. Even though I found the story amazing, I somehow never got to the other books. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DfKojCXOrOM/UG1YUS4vpdI/AAAAAAAAAVE/mGfsL6XxIrs/s1600/Game-of-Thrones.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DfKojCXOrOM/UG1YUS4vpdI/AAAAAAAAAVE/mGfsL6XxIrs/s400/Game-of-Thrones.png" width="580" /></a></div><br />Watching the TV show did however remind me of the books, and considering the fact that I recently plowed through all three&nbsp;Fifty Shades&nbsp;books without punching something or somebody, I decided it was about time I actually read something brilliantly written for a change.<br /><br />And I&#8217;ve been completely immersed in the series for a while now. It&#8217;s probably one of the only reasons why I still voluntarily put up with the awful public transit in Ljubljana - I found out that I can read a lot on my iPhone while waiting for the bus or riding the bus in peak hours. Which is probably why you always find me at the bus stations minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive. More time waiting for the bus = more reading time. <br /><br />One of the reasons why I love the series so much is the fact that it gives you a very realistic feel of the world. It&#8217;s crude, it&#8217;s real, and it&#8217;s full of complex characters that actually feel human. There&#8217;s nothing romantic about Martin&#8217;s knights. They bleed like everyone else, drink like most, and smell rotten after a week in prison. On the other hand, I can’t really say I know Aragorn that well.<br /><p>And there is a particularly interest aspect in the books for me: the slowness of communication and how utterly unaware most characters are about what&#8217;s going on in the rest of the world. They don&#8217;t have Twitter to cover the latest rumors about the dragons from across the sea. They don&#8217;t have paparazzi following queen Cersei around King&#8217;s Landing. They can&#8217;t make threats to distant foes in a blink of an eye through SMS or email. They don&#8217;t have people making &#8220;King Joffrey totally looks like his uncle Jaime&#8221; posters on <a href="http://roflrazzi.cheezburger.com/totallylookslike">meme sites</a>.</p><a name='more'></a>No, in a world where ravens and messengers on horses are the main tools for distance communication, information becomes valuable. If you&#8217;re good at gathering and distributing information, you can earn yourself a high place at the court, like the eunuch Varys. Messages take a long time to travel, and there are no read receipts. You can&#8217;t really be sure that the raven you sent hasn&#8217;t been shot down by an archer in training or worse, fallen into the wrong hands.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ebtCsoxP2fY/UG1WTUW1I2I/AAAAAAAAAUs/KsdFEl_xqIw/s1600/Varys.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ebtCsoxP2fY/UG1WTUW1I2I/AAAAAAAAAUs/KsdFEl_xqIw/s1600/Varys.jpg" width="580" /></a></div><br />You’d think the consequences of this would be devastating. In truth? Eh, sure, having more intel would speed up the game of thrones, but most folk just couldn’t care less. At least nobody wastes their every waking moment obsessing about getting all the news and gossip. If a raven makes it to your place, you get news from a distant place. But most days, you don&#8217;t, so you’re forced to deal with people around you. And you can just get along with your life without the fear of missing out on something important. <br /><br />And because the cost of sending information is so high (you have to have a trained bird and time to spare), there&#8217;s a special art in writing your letters. You can&#8217;t afford to send a &#8220;u there?&#8221; to the other side of the continent. Quills are almost as powerful as swords, and you have to think carefully about what and how you want to write. A simple mistake or misunderstanding could have tragic consequences and you can’t make it right with a simple “Sorry, damn autocorrect!” SMS.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IzbBEyVpyy0/UG1WUNwCk9I/AAAAAAAAAUw/6C7rVnWzQGs/s1600/raven-winterfell.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IzbBEyVpyy0/UG1WUNwCk9I/AAAAAAAAAUw/6C7rVnWzQGs/s1600/raven-winterfell.jpg" width="580" /></a></div><br />Compare that to our hyper connected world. In some ways, it is a true blessing. Information can flow freely, dictators have a harder time holding onto their iron thrones, we can create new content from people around the world. However, as it is in our nature, we don&#8217;t always use the tools at hand for good. We use Twitter to complain about insignificant things nobody cares about, we use our high-tech cameras to document the food we eat (guilty as charged!), but most tragically, we live in constant fear of missing out, so we keep reaching out to others, demanding attention. NOW!<br /><br />Email is often the biggest offender. It&#8217;s so easy to write an email, it made us all more sloppy at what we do. We&#8217;re less careful about our work, because in the back of our mind we know that others will soon drop us an email if we forget to do something. We are less confident about our work because we’re always coordinating stuff, waiting for the boss’ blessing. We are constantly scrutinized, every little mistake amplified to absurdity. A great example: Apple Maps. Technology sure is a wonderful thing, but we&#8217;ve come to expect too much of it sometimes. Yeah, I hear ya, pushing boundaries is great and all, but what if we just all took a deep breath and looked around at the big picture.<br /><br />That’s why I’m really starting to like this new, radical idea of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2012/10/why-im-joining-the-movement-to-stop-answering-after-hours-email.php">no after-hours emails</a> *gasp* Back to the basics. The world isn&#8217;t going to end if you don&#8217;t see that email right now. We all need time to recharge, time for ourselves when we aren&#8217;t thinking about what we have to do next and how to please everyone else. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do love what I&#8217;m doing (most days), always searching for news, trends, creating something new. But I&#8217;m truly happy when I can focus on one thing. When I can get lost in the flow of the moment without interruptions. Getting lost in a good book or writing my own story so intently that I forget to eat and sleep, going on a Sunday long run, making a cat happy and purring while he warms my lap or shoulder, getting lost in my husband&#8217;s arms or smile. Those are the moments I treasure the most, not the moments of &#8220;waiting for the important email&#8221;.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not saying we should just go back to middle ages, riding horses instead of cars (although that would be a pretty sweet thing!), fighting each other over stupid titles and lands, throwing all our wonderful tech away. No, I couldn&#8217;t do that to Siri. But perhaps we should think more about the value of communication, information. Make emails more valuable, not just these annoying nudges in our ribs. If you’re getting nudged often enough, you’ll eventually end up bruised or worse, with a broken rib. <br /><br />But perhaps we could bring back the ravens (not necessarily in physical form) for some of the things we do. Wouldn&#8217;t it be refreshing to get a raven with a general outline of what you have to do, and then you&#8217;d have to figure out how to do it without asking for more instructions or constant feedback? Sure, feedback is great, but email only gives you feedback from you loyal small council, which, more often than not, has no perspective on the lives of the smallfolk, yet is full of conflicting self-centered interests.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L-4CVVwiv10/UG1XkTCdXNI/AAAAAAAAAU8/aSSDh2i3FTU/s1600/games+of+thrones+small+council.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L-4CVVwiv10/UG1XkTCdXNI/AAAAAAAAAU8/aSSDh2i3FTU/s400/games+of+thrones+small+council.jpg" width="580" /></a></div><br />Why don’t we put more emphasis on getting out of the door, out of the office, wander the village asking for help? Maybe join a coworking space and get feedback from people from other industries outside your own bubble. I suspect we might end up with better ideas this way.<br /><br />I say, let’s bring back value to exchanging information, don’t treat it like a commodity. Maybe imagine a poor raven flying out whenever you press that Send button. Does the Raven really have to fly for what you have to say? Will more ravens be required to fly back and forth because you’ve spent too little time writing your message? Or maybe we&#8217;d just be better off with a meeting over beer/coffee/tea (and cake)?<br /><br />Yeah, it might just be that I’ve been reading too much fantasy lately and that is why my head is filled with ravens. Still, I do think we can an should be kinder to each other. Focus less on making noise and more on creating value.<br /><br /><i>P.S.: All images property of HBO.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>There&#8217;s a big shift happening in the world of consumer applications. The web is finally becoming a true visual medium. We are finally leaving the limitations of the early, text-based web and computers and embracing visual creative thinking.</p>Want some proof? <a href="http://instagr.am/"><b>Instagram</b></a>. Photo sharing mobile app with artsy filters <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17658264">sold to Facebook for 1 billion USD</a>. <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/30/instagram-50-million-users/">50 million users</a>, popular among teens. <a href="/2012/01/im-in-love-with-pinterest-and-why-that.html"><b>Pinterest</b></a>. One of the <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/04/05/pinterest-third-most-popular-social-network/">fastest growing social web sites</a>, centered around visual bookmarking, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/28/google-plus-ghost-town/">easily beats Google+ on engagement</a>. <a href="http://omgpop.com/drawsomething"><b>Draw Something</b></a>. Insanely popular mobile game, making millions of users finger paint with a childlike joy. Something is going on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BkXE-f3Epnc/T6pkeGCifhI/AAAAAAAAAK0/QsrdgbH74F4/s1600/instagram-pinterest-draw_something-cinemagram.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BkXE-f3Epnc/T6pkeGCifhI/AAAAAAAAAK0/QsrdgbH74F4/s1600/instagram-pinterest-draw_something-cinemagram.jpg" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b>In the beginning there was text and code</b></span><br /><br />Back in the early days of the web (and computer science, of course) it was all about text. Text was easy to transfer over painfully slow internet connections. Just look at early HTML - all those tags were designed to define text. Just one &lt;img&gt;&nbsp;tag for images. Now, of course we have super fancy CSS style sheets that make almost any design you can come up with in Photoshop possible on the web without image hacks. And it&#8217;s not really a problem anymore to have an image heavy website.<br /><br />Yet a lot of the services we use daily are still heavily based around text. E-mail is of course an obvious example, but traditional blogs, even social networks like Facebook and Twitter have been designed around text. Text messages, status updates. But this is changing. <a href="/2011/07/making-tumblr-my-online-home.html"><b>Tumblr</b></a>, a more visually oriented blogging platform, is becoming a more popular way to blog. And we create content for our Facebook and Twitter feeds with Instagram or Pinterest.<br /><br />This doesn&#8217;t mean that text is just disappearing. Of course not. <a href="http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2012/nt-2012-02-13-Why-ugly.htm">Ugly websites are still great at getting the job done</a>. It&#8217;s just that text is not in the spotlight anymore when it comes to user generated content. Photos and videos are much more fun to click on, seeing someone doing something is believing!<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b>Mobile devices as a catalyst for visual expression</b></span><br /><br />Mobile devices are of course a big cause for that. Touching text on a touch screen phone or tablet isn&#8217;t as fun as pinching in on a high res photo. The new &#8220;resolutionary&#8221; iPad demands website to get prettier, and mobile apps are becoming little works of art.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Mobile devices are of course making it easier to produce visual content. It&#8217;s never been easier to take a photo or shoot a video. Or even paint a sketch with our fingers in a fantastic app like <b><a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper">Paper</a></b>! We always have our mobile devices in our pockets, and we are finding that it&#8217;s actually easier to express ourselves visually than with text. A picture really is worth a thousand words.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EtcBOcty44E/T6paRrWYPlI/AAAAAAAAAKU/rKfpeo7GS8U/s1600/iphone-camera.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EtcBOcty44E/T6paRrWYPlI/AAAAAAAAAKU/rKfpeo7GS8U/s1600/iphone-camera.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Is it any wonder that the camera is one of the most loved features of iPhone 4S?</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>When I look at my Instagram history, each photo evokes emotions like no text-based status update can. I remember the moment more vividly, I remember how and where I was sitting or standing when I took the photo, and I can almost remember the full scent and touch of that moment….<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b>Learning to draw and paint to foster creative thinking</b></span><br /><br />Like it or not, vision has always been an important part of our species from an evolutional point of view. Writing is an artifact, while the ability to observe our environment with our eyes is deeply embedded in us. And we are just now learning a new visual language, a language that has historically been the domain of various visual artists and too difficult to master for common folk. But now anyone can take a photo with a mobile phone in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />No, it doesn&#8217;t mean everyone is an artist now, just like being able to write doesn&#8217;t make you a good writer. But I do believe we are witnessing a revival of visual communication. And consequently encouraging people to engage their creative parts of the brain. Instagram isn&#8217;t about logic, it&#8217;s about emotion.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ErmunTR5Pes/T6pdSxKex0I/AAAAAAAAAKg/7zscZgK2DXI/s1600/instagram-crow-ialja.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ErmunTR5Pes/T6pdSxKex0I/AAAAAAAAAKg/7zscZgK2DXI/s320/instagram-crow-ialja.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">One of my favorite Instagram photos</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>While the fact that we are writing less and creating images with fancy filters more might worry some, I do believe it&#8217;s a sign of progress. Our education has emphasized logic and shunned creativity for far too long. We live in a world of big problem that require big ideas. Not just logical ideas, but crazy, insane, passionate ideas.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b>Rediscovering intuition for big ideas</b></span><br /><br />And that means engaging our creative side. Rediscovering intuition. Steve Jobs is a great example of how intuition can guide us towards great solutions. Yes, we need logic to develop the technology, but intuition and liberal arts are also valuable tools that can steer the technology into the right direction. And allow us to see and wonder at the big picture. To pursue beauty and value, not just revenue.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KfWkMUYJQuI/T6piMR9ZZQI/AAAAAAAAAKs/pJqNTagMK8k/s1600/instagram-ialja.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KfWkMUYJQuI/T6piMR9ZZQI/AAAAAAAAAKs/pJqNTagMK8k/s1600/instagram-ialja.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Instagram helps us find beauty in everyday moments</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Am I stretching it too far? Perhaps. I like to dream big. But something is going on. Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest, Draw Something, Cinemagram, Viddy, Socialcam… these are not just coincidences. It&#8217;s an emerging trend we can no longer ignore.<br /><br />In fact, I think we all need to embrace it, and to foster the creativity in our kids, in ourselves. Teach ourself design thinking and creative problem solving. We all need to become a little <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/steve-jobs-told-students-stay-hungry-stay-foolish/2011/10/05/gIQA1qVjOL_blog.html">more hungry and foolish</a> to better prepare ourselves for the uncertain future ahead of us.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/05/instagram-and-new-renaissance-of-visual.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/05/instagram-and-new-renaissance-of-visual.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a confession to make. There is a new website that is capturing an increasing number of spare minutes in life. It provides an endless stream of visual inspiration, and every time you use it, you can&#8217;t help but feel a bit more creative. Yep, I&#8217;m in love with <a href="http://pinterest.com/"><b>Pinterest</b></a>, the latest over-hyped tech media darling.</p>I did try to resist it, I swear. When I saw the first blog posts about it, I thought I didn&#8217;t need a service like that. I tried to convince myself that Tumblr and Instagram were enough for me. And I didn&#8217;t want to fall into the whole &#8221;<a href="http://www.maternalinstinct.com/2011/11/21/5-reasons-pinterest-catnip-women/">women love Pinterest</a>&#8221; stereotype. But then, as the hype kept growing, I gave in to my curiosity and a professional dedication to trying out all the new cool social services in town. And I haven&#8217;t looked back ever since. Why is that, and why does it matter?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://pinterest.com/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wwpX6y87uyI/TyAEYExDXDI/AAAAAAAAAJA/aB5Dro8MNOQ/s1600/pinterest-ialja.jpg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Pint-huh-ha?</span></b><br /><br />So, what is the big deal? <a href="http://pinterest.com/about/">Pinterest describes itself</a> as a virtual pinboard, a place where you can <i>&#8220;organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web&#8221;</i>. Often, you see it described as a bookmarking service with a focus on images. If you ask me, all these descriptions don&#8217;t really encapsulate the real spirit of the service. Pinterest in basically a great visual experience that you have to try on your own to really get it.<br /><br />Using it is pretty simple: you drag a &#8220;Pin It&#8221; bookmarklet to your browser&#8217;s bookmarks bar, and then click on it whenever you stumble on an interesting image on the web. If you&#8217;ve got a minute to spare, you can see how easy the whole thing is in the video below:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/L2tImC_2Gnw" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Of course, you can also &#8220;repin&#8221; images other Pinterst users share. Regardless of whether you create your own original pins or play the curator and just choose the best pins from the community to highlight, each pin helps you construct your own visual board around different themes. And you can even create collaborative boards with your friends.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">What can we learn from Pinterest?</span></b><br /><br />As you can see, the service itself is pretty straightforward. However, if we scratch the surface a little, we can easily find simple, yet valuable secret ingredients that can help any service or product become more awesome in today&#8217;s competitive world:<br /><br /><b>1) Delight and surprise the curious animal inside me or I&#8217;ll move on</b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dbarronoss/2407592576/" title="Curious by dbarronoss, on Flickr"><img alt="Curious" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3079/2407592576_b433990b06.jpg" /></a></div><br /><i>aka</i><b><i> Build insanely great user experiences</i>:</b> It&#8217;s never been easier to design and create stunning user interfaces that captivate users&#8217; attention. This is not the web we knew in 1995 (<a href="http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/the-evolution-of-web-design/">remember?</a>). Honestly, what is your excuse for not investing into good design and a polished user experience? No resources left?<br /><br />Well then, what in the world makes you think I&#8217;m going to spend my precious time figuring out where to click next or how to open your box? Don&#8217;t be selfish, take my hand and show me where you want me to go. I don&#8217;t have time to waste for aimless wandering among buttons, site maps and what now. I&#8217;m a curious animal, who wants to be delighted and surprised.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-secret-to-pinterests-astounding-success-a-brilliant-sign-up-process-you-should-copy-2012-1">Look at how Pinterest makes it easy for users to signup, connect with their friends, and discover cool content right from the start</a>. It&#8217;s an insanely great learning experience!<br /><br /><b>2) The importance of spotting the snake in the bush and telling your friends about it&nbsp;</b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonkeegan/935041912/" title="Black Racer (zoomed) by jonkeegan, on Flickr"><img alt="Black Racer (zoomed)" src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1130/935041912_11b33dd028.jpg" /></a></div><br /><i>aka <b>We&#8217;re all social visual learners</b></i><b>:</b> Yes, looks matter. Not because you can attract women with pointless &#8220;bling&#8221; (that, of course, couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth). Looks matter because evolutionally we have been programmed to be keen visual learners. Those of our ancestors, whom failed to spot the snake in the bush, didn&#8217;t live to tell the tale. And that is what makes all of us naturally curious visual observers.<br /><br />And it is why Pinterest is such a magical place. Everywhere you look, it&#8217;s just full of beautiful photos your eyes can feast upon. <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~cogsci/cogpsy/theeuwes/Visual_Cognition_2006_Faces.pdf">Research has shown that faces capture our attention</a> like nothing else, so why are you still building websites, writing books, making videos etc. that don&#8217;t have a face, that don&#8217;t focus on people? Images are a very powerful universal language for connecting people. And social is not just a buzz word, it&#8217;s the best way to learn, discover, and have fun.<br /><br />Us girls have an especially good nose for great social and visual experiences, that&#8217;s why Pinterest is such a bit hit and is able to attract typically non early adopters. It isn&#8217;t just about women, though attracting female users early on is certainly a good sign that you&#8217;re onto something good. Most importantly though, <a href="http://ialja.com/post/16459626047/design-for-how-people-learn-voices-that-matter">learn about what makes us tick as human beings</a>, and apply it to whatever your doing.<br /><br /><b>3) Don&#8217;t make me walk on land when I&#8217;m enjoying a swim in the ocean</b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kankan/19828575/" title="Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium by Kanko*, on Flickr"><img alt="Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/15/19828575_21a849b7f0.jpg" /></a></div><br /><i>aka </i><b><i>Mobile matters</i>:</b> having a great user experience on the website is all good and fine. But don&#8217;t make me visit your website at all costs. You can use Facebook to show my friends what I&#8217;m up to, a bookmarket to make it easier to create content, and if you really want to stay competitive in today&#8217;s world, you also have to plan for a great mobile experience. And that is why Pinterest, even though it&#8217;s a pretty fresh service, already has a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinterest/id429047995?mt=8">pretty cool iPhone app</a>. <br /><br />The best thing about the app is the way it lets you focus on content as you scroll down the stream of pins; all unnecessary elements momentarily disappear, so that you don&#8217;t get distracted by what you don&#8217;t need. A great idea that aligns perfects with the purpose of the app and makes the service more accessible. Whether you need your fix of inspiration at home or on the road, Pinterest is there to provide a great service.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The big picture</span></b><br /><br />So, why am I writing about all of this? Yes, partly it is so I can justify all the time spent on Pinterest as &#8220;doing research&#8221;, but mostly because Pinterest (an several other hip startups as well) makes me excited about the future of the web. A future where it will be easier to get around, where content will be increasingly more engaging, and where it won&#8217;t matter which device you&#8217;ll want to use to do your favorite thing; the experience will always be great.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iI-9vICkvgg/TyAJO_pdxaI/AAAAAAAAAJI/mHvpalmpbeY/s1600/pinterest-ialja-boards.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iI-9vICkvgg/TyAJO_pdxaI/AAAAAAAAAJI/mHvpalmpbeY/s1600/pinterest-ialja-boards.jpg" /></a></div><br />And while it might be easy to dismiss Pinterest as a superficial fad with no real value, I think it can be a great discovery tool and a new way for people to communicate and share experiences with one another. Because it is through experiences that we learn best.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;">P.S.: <a href="http://pinterest.com/ialja/"><img alt="Follow Me on Pinterest" height="26" src="http://passets-cdn.pinterest.com/images/follow-on-pinterest-button.png" width="156" /></a> </div></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/01/im-in-love-with-pinterest-and-why-that.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/01/im-in-love-with-pinterest-and-why-that.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
