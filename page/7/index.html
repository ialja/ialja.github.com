<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande';">O</span>ne of the most important things for a pleasant <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> experience for you and your friends is knowing how to manage your Wall and News Feed, which I suspect is not something that a lot of Facebook users know how to do well. That&#8217;s why I decided to share some tips on how to deal with &#8220;spam&#8221; created by social applications and games like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FarmVille">FarmVille</a> and how to&nbsp;peacefully&nbsp;coexist with your friends whether you&#8217;re a social gamer or not.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #0b5394;">How not to spam all your friends while enjoying social games</span></b><br /><br />Let&#8217;s start with some tips for social gamers. Our favorite social games would like nothing more than let all of our friends know how much fun we&#8217;re having in the game. And while we appreciate the treasures our friends post to our News Feed, we also have friends who just don&#8217;t see the appeal of farm life and similar hobbies (yet!). So, what can you do if you want to keep sharing lost animals, eggs, fuel and what not with your game friends, but at the same time don&#8217;t want to spam your friends who hate the game?<br /><br />The solution is pretty simple: <b>use Friend Lists</b>. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=768">Friend Lists</a> can be created and managed by choosing Edit Friends from the Account menu (top right). Once you create your game list, you can add your game neighbors to that Friend List and whenever you&#8217;re prompted to publish something on your wall, make it visible only to your game friend list. For instance, I have a Friend List for all my active FarmVille neighbors and whenever I post something, I make sure only people on that list get to see it:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7NtO5cm9LI/AAAAAAAAAiI/olVMPqJZkIk/s1600/Facebook+Post+Visibility+-+Customize.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7NtO5cm9LI/AAAAAAAAAiI/olVMPqJZkIk/s320/Facebook+Post+Visibility+-+Customize.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><i>Step 1: Before Publishing a story, click on the privacy lock and select &#8220;Customize&#8221;</i></span></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7NtXxTyRtI/AAAAAAAAAiQ/ugp2xBUxGn4/s1600/Facebook+Post+Visibility+-+Friend+List+2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7NtXxTyRtI/AAAAAAAAAiQ/ugp2xBUxGn4/s320/Facebook+Post+Visibility+-+Friend+List+2.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Step 2: Select &#8220;Specific People&#8221; in the &#8220;Make this visible to&#8221; drop-down menu and start typing the name of your game specific Friend List;</span></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Save Settings and you&#8217;re ready to Publish your update</span></i></div><br />Yes, it does take some time to set up the list and manually manage all posts, but on the plus side you don&#8217;t have to bother your students, coworkers, clients or whoever with your FarmVille addiction (unless you want to) and you will avoid complaints about your FarmVille &#8220;spam&#8221; from friends, who haven&#8217;t yet discovered the magic Hide option in the News Feed (more about that in a minute). But don&#8217;t forget to check back on your game Friend List(s) once in a while to add your new game buddies or remove friends that have stopped playing the game.<br /><br />Another helpful thing you can do if you don&#8217;t want to see your profile Wall cluttered with various game updates, is to p<b>revent games from publishing short stories on your wall</b>. You can do that by choosing &#8220;Application Settings&#8221; from the &#8220;Account&#8221; menu (top right). Find your application on the list, click on &#8220;Edit Settings&#8221; and check the &#8220;Additional Permissions&#8221; tab in the box that opens.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7Nr2l9_sgI/AAAAAAAAAiA/3dRQG-dIXyU/s1600/Facebook+Application+Settings.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7Nr2l9_sgI/AAAAAAAAAiA/3dRQG-dIXyU/s320/Facebook+Application+Settings.png" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">I love you FarmVille, but please don&#8217;t spam my wall:</span></i></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">I always uncheck the &#8220;Publish recent activity&#8221; option for games</span></i></div><br />Bonus tip: don&#8217;t spam all your friends with game invites. Send invites only when you really think a certain person is going to enjoy the game or application you are playing. And don&#8217;t send various in-game gifts to friends that are not playing your game!<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #0b5394;">How to hide or block unwanted apps your friends play</span></b><br /><br />Ok, and what can you do if you just can&#8217;t stand the spam your friends publish through various Facebook applications? Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s no need to remove all your friends or quit Facebook; just <b>make good use of the &#8220;Hide&#8221; button</b> in your News Feed.<br /><br />Hiding apps (or people) you don&#8217;t want to see in your News Feed is easy: hover over one of the posts you don&#8217;t like, and click on the &#8220;Hide&#8221; button that appears in the top right corner of the post.&nbsp;You then have two options:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7NqHzwtUpI/AAAAAAAAAhw/TodvTmo-wvQ/s1600/Hide+News+Feed+item+Facebook.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="59" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7NqHzwtUpI/AAAAAAAAAhw/TodvTmo-wvQ/s640/Hide+News+Feed+item+Facebook.png" width="468" /></a></div><ul><li>hide all News Feed posts from your friend that posted the update or</li><li>hide all&nbsp;News Feed posts&nbsp;from a certain app.</li></ul><ul></ul>You can unhide friends/pages/applications by clicking on &#8220;Edit Options&#8221; link at the right bottom of your News Feed.<br /><br />And if you have a very insistent friend, who keeps sending you requests for an application you&#8217;re just not interested in (or if you&#8217;re trying to recover from a game addiction), don&#8217;t forget that you also have the option to completely <b>Block an application</b>. Just visit the application page and click on the block link to never see or receive anything from that application again.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7NrmE1JRpI/AAAAAAAAAh4/hjqA4PRQg00/s1600/Facebook+Block+Application+s.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S7NrmE1JRpI/AAAAAAAAAh4/hjqA4PRQg00/s320/Facebook+Block+Application+s.png" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">&#8220;Block Application&#8221; option on an application page</span></i></div><br />I hope these tips can help you enjoy Facebook more and prevent your game addictions get in the way of your friendships or even reputation :) If you have any other tips or suggestions, feel free to share them in the comments. And make sure to enjoy your games without spamming your friends!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/03/facebook-news-feed-and-social-games-how.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/03/facebook-news-feed-and-social-games-how.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Lately,&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8367957.stm">some</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%253A%252F%252Fping.fm%252F3t2FZ&amp;h=4e47f45a99007ffda610c987e703086c&amp;ref=mf">articles</a>&nbsp;wondered about what had happened to <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>, the virtual world that had a quite intensive hype period in 2007 and 2008. Usually, these articles follow a similar pattern: a journalists revisits the &#8220;lost&#8221; virtual world, isn&#8217;t really impressed by what he/she sees. The article is then followed by a few comments by average visitors, who tend to agree with the journalist, and then the Second Life community discovers the article and start defending their world with examples of great projects being done in Second Life and sooner or later accuse the journalist of not going to the right places and not taking enough time.<br /><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #134f5c;">Second Life is a niche</span></b><br /><br />Well, here&#8217;s the thing: I did spend a lot of time in Second Life, met many, many wonderful people in there, and I know what great things people are doing there. So I hope I can add my 2 cents into the debate from a fair perspective. If you ask me, SL certainly isn&#8217;t dead, and it is in fact doing quite well from a <a href="https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/features/blog/2009/04/09/state-of-the-economy">business perspective</a>. But I also think it&#8217;s fair to say that it is a niche service. It&#8217;s great for content creators, artists, musicians, it&#8217;s great for people with enough patience and perseverance to put up with the lag and other technical issues. But it&#8217;s awful for the average internet user, and I must confess that I&#8217;m also having difficulties with finding reasons to log in other than to read and respond to the occasional message or notice.<br /><br />Yes, you can attend many wonderful events, see a lot of great art etc.. But only if you are prepared to spend a lot of time troubleshooting various technical problems. Have meetings? Yes, but only with people already using SL. In all these years I haven&#8217;t managed to convince a single friend to try out SL, and believe me, I tried!<br /><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #134f5c;">Doing one thing really, really well</span></b><br /><br />I think the main problem with Second Life is that it can do almost everything, but that it doesn&#8217;t do anything really, really well, but at the same time it has a huge learning curve. On the other hand, a more limited virtual world like <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> is really good at keeping its users engaged and entertained for hours and hours. No, you can&#8217;t have your own house or design your own clothes in there, but nonetheless you have a lot of fun! And I must confess that lately I prefer killing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Murloc">Murlocs</a>&nbsp;in <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Azeroth_(world)">Azeroth</a> (and paying for it!)&nbsp;to waiting for the newest Second Life wonder to load.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S0TOb1Z6XLI/AAAAAAAAAgI/D_PrJLLZRlQ/s1600-h/ialja_altaya.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S0TOb1Z6XLI/AAAAAAAAAgI/D_PrJLLZRlQ/s400/ialja_altaya.jpg" /></a><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="color: #999999;"><span style="font-size: small;">My lil&#8217; gnome mage (right) might not have custom hair or skin like my SL avatar (left), but she&#8217;s more fun to hang out with</span></span></i><br /></div><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #134f5c;">A lot of potential, but not there yet</span></b><br /><br />Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I still do believe that virtual worlds have a lot of potential, potential for education, potential for doing business. But I can&#8217;t teach if my students have to spend hours just to start feeling comfortable in a new environment, and I can&#8217;t do business meetings without having any of my business partners in-world. I would love to do all that, to save all of us the environmental and other costs of travels, but I can&#8217;t.<br /><br />So, while there is a lot of potential, there isn&#8217;t a virtual world that fully uses it - at least not for the average user, who isn&#8217;t willing to spend hours learning a new piece of software.<br /><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #134f5c;">Who is going to reinvent virtual worlds?</span></b><br /><br />And that is why I&#8217;m still waiting for someone that will be able to reinvent virtual worlds in such a way that it will be easy and nice to have classes in-world or business meetings. And at this point I&#8217;m not sure <a href="http://lindenlab.com/">Linden Lab</a>, the makers of Second Life, will be able to pull that off. M Linden is no Steve Jobs. And what we need is an iPhone of virtual worlds. Something that will be so intuitive, so sexy that everyone will want a piece of it. &nbsp;Something with an awesome user interface that is able to provide a great user experience. That&#8217;s the one thing my ideal virtual world should do really, really well.<br /><br />And while I&#8217;m running out of patience for Second Life&#8217;s technical woes, I still believe that someday something that reinvents virtual worlds will come along. Perhaps it will be some sort of augmented reality application or something entirely new. I don&#8217;t know, but I can wait for the right thing.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/01/second-life-isnt-dead-but-its-niche.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/01/second-life-isnt-dead-but-its-niche.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SwMDoagwNVI/AAAAAAAAAd8/UKZ8UM_r7mY/s1600/google+wave.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SwMDoagwNVI/AAAAAAAAAd8/UKZ8UM_r7mY/s200/google+wave.png" /></a>I recently got my <a href="http://wave.google.com/">Google Wave</a> invite* <span style="color: #999999;">(thanks to </span><a href="http://www.merhar.si/"><span style="color: #999999;">Jure</span></a><span style="color: #999999;">)</span> and I wanted to share some of my initial impressions. As most of you probably know already, Google Wave is an online real-time collaboration and communication tool, which combines elements of e-mail, instant messaging, social networks and wikis <span style="color: #999999;">(watch the </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6pgxLaDdQw"><span style="color: #999999;">overview video</span></a><span style="color: #999999;"> for more info)</span>.<br /><br />It was first announced in May, with a big promise of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_wave_google_tries_to_reinvent_email.php">reinventing e-mail for the 21st century</a>. It has been in private beta for some time now, and it&#8217;s been getting mixed reviews with many people marking it as <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/10/01/google-wave-crashes-on-beach-of-overhype/">overhyped</a>. So I was really curious to try it out on my own and see if it can live up to its (big) expectations.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve now been using Google Wave for about a week with various existing and new contacts. Currently, one big limitation is that you don&#8217;t get any invites when you start using the service, so your pool of contacts is initially quite limited and therefore you probably won&#8217;t be able to immediately use the tools in that many real-life situations. Overall, I still believe this tool has a lot of potential to replace many collaboration tools <span style="color: #999999;">(don&#8217;t think it will replace e-mail in the near future though)</span>, but it still needs some important features before if can go really public.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #073763;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">The cool features</span></b></span><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><span style="color: #073763;"><b><br /></b></span>These are the main things I like about Wave:<br /><ul><li>the basic functions are quite easy to use and understand <span style="color: #999999;">(although I was already familiar with the basic philosophy and interface from watching the </span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ"><span style="color: #999999;">hour long developer preview</span></a><span style="color: #999999;">)</span>,</li><li>easier to use than wikis because of a familiar e-mail like interface,</li><li>the ability to collaborate in different ways,</li><li>adding links with the Google Search function is really cool,</li><li>you can get a lot of additional functionality with Wave extensions like the <a href="http://wave-samples-gallery.appspot.com/about_app?app_id=64007">Mind Map gadget</a> shown below.</li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SwMImIxmWPI/AAAAAAAAAeU/0Qs_HO-2opw/s1600/wave+mind+map+gadget.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SwMImIxmWPI/AAAAAAAAAeU/0Qs_HO-2opw/s400/wave+mind+map+gadget.jpg" /></a><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="color: #999999;">Using the Mind Map Gadget in a wave: the initial mind map was created by me, other participants were able to add and vote on the elements </span></i><br /></div><br /><span style="color: #073763; font-weight: 800;"></span><br /><div><span style="color: #073763; font-weight: 800;"><span style="font-size: large;">The missing features</span></span><br /><br />And here are the main things that I don&#8217;t like:<br /><ul><li>you can&#8217;t add new Wave extensions with one simple click <span style="color: #999999;">(</span><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/wave/extensions/installers/"><span style="color: #999999;">here is how you do it</span></a><span style="color: #999999;"> - ouch!)</span>,</li><li>embedding waves on the web should be as easy as embedding YouTube videos,</li><li>as a wave creator, you should have more control over who can edit your waves and in what way <span style="color: #999999;">(currently every wave participant can edit everything in a wave)</span>,</li><li>when using Wave you&#8217;re always shown as online to your contacts and there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it,</li><li>participants in the same wave can see what you&#8217;re typing in real-time and you can&#8217;t change that<span style="color: #999999;"><span style="color: black;">; real-time typing is useful in some cases, but not always </span>(a good thing about e-mail is that you can rethink and rewrite your message before it gets sent out)</span>,</li><li>you should be able to organize contacts into groups,</li><li>the ability to edit blips in a wave and adding in-line comments isn&#8217;t very intuitive or easy to use, so most people just keep adding replies at the end of the wave, which easily turns waves into noisy chatrooms; as my friend <a href="http://angelaathomas.com/">Angela</a> said in a wave conversation: <i><span style="color: #6aa84f;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the same as IRC but with rich content&#8221;</span></i>,</li><li>you can&#8217;t delete waves.</li></ul><span style="color: #073763;"><b><br /></b></span><b><span style="color: #073763;"><span style="font-size: large;">Bottom Line: Not there yet, but certainly useful in the real world</span></span></b><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br />So, Google Wave provides a lot of great functions, but it lacks many privacy/permissions settings, plus a lot of features are still too difficult to use. A lot of users also complain that it can also be quite slow (<span style="color: #999999;">especially if you add a lot of extensions in a long wave)</span>. But let&#8217;s not forget that Wave is still in beta, so I hope that some of the main annoyances get fixed before it opens up to the public. I browsed through <a href="http://productideas.appspot.com/#16/e=224f1">Product Ideas for Google Wave</a> today, and I think most users agree on the basic improvements that Wave needs.<br /><br />Even though my list of missing features isn&#8217;t short, I&#8217;m still a Google Wave believer and can&#8217;t wait to try it out in the real world. For example, I really like the idea of using Google Wave at <a href="http://blog.freshnetworks.com/2009/11/google-wave-vs-twitter-at-conferences/">conferences</a> and in <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_wave_use_cases_education.php">classrooms</a> or the ability to use <a href="http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-506/wilson.pdf">Google Wave widgets in Moodle courses</a> <span style="color: #999999;">(I&#8217;m also looking forward to an activity module for embedding whole waves into Moodle)</span>.<br /><span style="color: #073763;"><b><br /></b></span><br /><b><span style="color: #073763;"><span style="font-size: large;">Links that can get you started</span></span></b><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br />If you&#8217;re just getting started with Google Wave and still feeling a bit lost, I suggest you check out the 5 minutes <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBzuuWZPaXc&amp;NR=1">overview of 15 key Google Wave features</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/05/28/google-wave-guide/">Mashable&#8217;s Google Wave Complete Guide</a>. If you&#8217;re on a Mac, you can also try out <a href="http://www.getwaveboard.com/">Waveboard</a>, a desktop app for Google Wave. Personally, I keep Waveboard always open, so I can see when new waves or changes are made.

We&#8217;re all naturally curious beings, but our day to day lives often get stuck in predictable routines that can dull our minds. And what&#8217;s a great way to wake up our curiosity? <b>The unexpected</b><b>.</b> Something that makes us pause and wonder, something that requires us to reconsider what we know about the world.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Like the company that added the <a href="http://www.serviceuntitled.com/a-wake-up-call-for-bored-customers/2009/10/08/">ability to hear a duck quack</a> when calling their toll-free number. Or <a href="http://thefuntheory.com/">The Fun Theory initiative</a>, which among others included the world&#8217;s deepest bin to motivate people to throw garbage into the trash bin.

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SrkMELg8EII/AAAAAAAAAdU/y2wt_SKpZN4/s1600-h/questions.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 187px; height: 216px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SrkMELg8EII/AAAAAAAAAdU/y2wt_SKpZN4/s320/questions.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5384348095448092802" border="0" /></a>My experience with teaching online courses<span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> (and participating in various online communities)</span> has led me to believe that there are three basic groups of people when it comes to finding answers to their questions:<br /><ul><li><b>Social learners</b>: people who prefer finding answers by <span style="font-style: italic;">asking other people</span>.</li><li><b>Resource learners</b>: people who prefer finding answers <span style="font-style: italic;">on their own</span> using any available resource. </li><li><b>Passive learners</b>: people who prefer <span style="font-style: italic;">waiting for answers to find them</span>. </li></ul>We can be part of a different group in different settings, although usually people tend to have a preference for one of the groups. And why do I find this important? I think it&#8217;s important to be aware of how people prefer finding solutions to their problems when you&#8217;re trying to teach people or provide technical or other types of support. And be willing to accommodate differences in their favorite approach. This is especially important in an online setting, where there&#8217;s a spatial and often a time barrier when you&#8217;re interacting with your students, colleagues or clients.<br /><br />What the first group, the <b>social learners</b>, needs the most is an easy way to ask other people their questions. Provide them with different channels, make yourself available. And if you want them to keep asking questions, you have to make sure they get their answers in a reasonable time frame and that the answers provide enough information value and that they don&#8217;t make the person feel bad or even stupid for asking the question. Thank the people when they&#8217;re asking questions, and try your best to answer them. And don&#8217;t forget that often an honest &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ll have to look it up.&#8221; can be the right answer. Also, be prepared to answer the same questions all over again, but don&#8217;t be afraid to link to previous answers when you&#8217;re working in an online environment.<br /><br />In a large group of people the second group, the <b>resource learners</b>, can also help you provide the right answers for social learners. Resource learners often like the challenge of an open question and will gladly share what they&#8217;ve learned on their own to help out their peers. Just take a look at <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Answers</a>. What you can do to help resource learners solve their problems more effectively, is providing a lot of different resources, which should be easily accessible and searchable.<br /><br />The most difficult group to deal with are the <b>passive learners</b>. They tend to solve problems by following what others do, find answers that are not related to the question or simply walk away. Different circumstances can make an individual a passive learner, such as lack of time or interest, lack of confidence when using an unknown communication tool or even fear of asking the wrong questions. They often complain when they don&#8217;t achieve the expected results, but you just can&#8217;t seem to be able to convince them that asking questions when problems arise can help them solve problems.<br /><br />So what can we do to help passive learners? My usual approach is to provide regular directions from different angles, sometimes provide answers to questions nobody is explicitly asking, and to keep offering help. Some people just might need some time to start feeling comfortable before they start asking questions, and I try to make sure they know it&#8217;s never too late to start.<br /><br />But at the end of the day don&#8217;t forget that you probably won&#8217;t always be able to turn every passive learner into a social or resource learner. This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you&#8217;ve done something wrong or they are not successful learners. It might just not be the right time, place or circumstance for them. You can&#8217;t always help everyone, but do try to find out how you can best help each individual.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/09/helping-people-find-answers.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/09/helping-people-find-answers.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Here&#8217;s the thing: I don&#8217;t believe one or two days long workshops really work when you&#8217;re trying to change the way people do something or convince them to use a new tool. These workshops are like a first date. It can go really well, you get all excited&#8230; but then, the next day, you have this urgent thing at work to do, so you don&#8217;t have time to call back&#8230; and then you have another big project to plan and&#8230; oh wait, what was the workshop all about? I&#8217;ll go to another one next year.<br /><br />The <b>problem</b> with short workshops is that <b>you usually make a good impression, but you don&#8217;t develop a relationship</b>. Sure, you <i>might</i> get one or two people excited enough to get involved with the subject further, but most people won&#8217;t. Most people won&#8217;t really <i>get it</i> after a day or two. They need the time and place to figure things out on their own. If there&#8217;s somebody by your side immediately solving all your problems<i> for you</i>, you don&#8217;t really learn much.<br /><br />So, <b>what do I believe in</b>? I believe in <b>longer lasting</b> workshops where participants are gently guided by a <b>tutor</b>, but require participants to <b>invest their time and energy in </b><b>solving problems</b>. I believe in workshops that keep participants active with <b>r</b><b>egular challenges</b> and that provide a lot of <b>feedback</b> for the participants. And workshops that provide some <b>follow-up</b>, opportunities for keeping the relationship alive even after the workshop is officially over.<br /><br />For example, I recently guided several groups of teachers through a three weeks long Moodle introductory workshop delivered online, through Moodle. During that time I was there for the participants to help them get through problems on their own, and to encourage them, to let them know they were doing a great job. The time we spent together was enough to start developing a good relationship, but I also tried hard to let them know that was just the beginning: <i>Yes, you have successfully completed the training, but this is where the real work begins. Go into your own classrooms now, and practice. And nowadays there&#8217;s always a way to get more help online; either from other users or from me. <b>The important thing is that you keep asking questions!</b></i><br /><br />The thing to keep in mind here is that adopting a new tool/way of thinking <span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#999999;">(aka learning)</span> is <b>not an event, it&#8217;s a process</b>. And not an easy one, so don&#8217;t expect to be done with it in a few hours by having people clicking together in the same room!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/07/problem-with-workshops.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/07/problem-with-workshops.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Yesterday Google announced <a href="http://www.google.com/squared">Google Squared</a>, a new release from <a href="http://www.googlelabs.com/">Google Labs</a>. From the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/06/square-your-search-results-with-google.html">official announcement</a>: <i>&#8220;Google Squared is an experimental search tool that collects facts from the web and presents them in an organized collection, similar to a spreadsheet.&#8221;</i>. I&#8217;ve played with it for a while today, and while it might <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_squared_is_live_who_knew_structured_data_co.php">not be the best way to search</a> for things, I can imagine a lot of great ways to use it in classrooms.<div><div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SifH85umhrI/AAAAAAAAAa8/_mRyOD7QAS4/s1600-h/square+example.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 232px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SifH85umhrI/AAAAAAAAAa8/_mRyOD7QAS4/s400/square+example.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343459332000745138" /></a><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><i><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="color:#999999;">A sample Square on cloud types</span></i></span></div><div>The most obvious use is for teachers to use Google Squared sheets as <b>learning materials</b>. You can easily create a list of <a href="http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=US%20presidents&amp;suggest=1">US presidents</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=African%20countries&amp;suggest=6">african countries</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=renaissance%20artists&amp;suggest=14">renaissance artists</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=cat+breeds">cats breeds</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/squared/search?q=learning+management+systems">learning management systems</a>, &#8230; and much more. Textbooks are all full of lists, but they are static. With Squared, you can create your own list, edit rows, columns and data, and easily change the whole list whenever you want to. </div><div>The automatically generated lists are (of course) far from perfect, but that&#8217;s exactly where I see the biggest learning opportunity. You can present an incomplete list to your students and have them <b>find missing data or check the validity </b>of the provided data. You can also have students try to create their own lists (you can even start with an empty table), save them on their Google accounts, and then compare lists with peers. Who got the data right? Is your data source reliable?  I think this can be a great exercise on how to deal with online resources. And even the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/faqs/bin/answer.py?answer=139211">Squared Help page</a> emphasizes double-checking the information in your Square! :)</div><div>Do you see Google Squared being useful in classrooms?</div></div></div></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/06/google-squared-great-tool-for-educators.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/06/google-squared-great-tool-for-educators.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
