  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This week <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/cataclysm/">Cataclysm</a>, the third, long-awaited expansion for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> (WoW), has finally been released. The expansion brought many changes to the game and completely redesigned Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, the two old continents that have been part of the game since its launch. In a sense, it does feel like a new game all together, and even experienced players have to relearn many aspects of the game.<br /><br />But I&#8217;m not here to talk about all the game changes and complain about the missing portals in Outland and Northrend. Instead, I&#8217;d like to play a bit with some of the new elements of the game that facilitate learning and could be used to improve serious (aka not fun) online learning.<br /><br />It must be said that WoW has never been a difficult game to learn. The basic mechanics and interface elements are pretty straightforward and easy to pick up even for casual players like myself. But I&#8217;ve got a feeling they took everything even a step further in the new expansion. Let&#8217;s take a look at examples I&#8217;ve encountered so far as I&#8217;m trying to level up my gnome mage to level 85. So please, hop on my flying gryphon, so I can show you around.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQJKzik9FBI/AAAAAAAAAoo/8kF06s4kshw/s1600/altaya-azeroth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQJKzik9FBI/AAAAAAAAAoo/8kF06s4kshw/s1600/altaya-azeroth.jpg" /></a></div><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Just in time learning</span></b><br /><br />Cataclysm seems to be really good at providing simple tips to guide you through the game. For instance, as you reach a new level, you get notified of any new abilities or talent points that are available to you. A small, but very useful reminder.<br /><br />Similar tips have also been implemented in some of the quests (missions you complete in the game). Apart from tips and hints in the quest instructions, you now also get easy to follow tips as you do the quest. For instance, tips on the procedure needed to complete the quest: <i>1) equip the lance, 2) now mount the bird, 3) ok, now click the button to flap the wings and make the bird fly!</i> Easy to understand, and displayed just when you need it; you&#8217;re not told how to fly the bird unless you&#8217;ve got your lance ready and have saddled up the bird.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/G40vof3AUaM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/G40vof3AUaM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br />Sounds simple, yes? So why don&#8217;t we display tips like that in our online learning environments? <i>&#8220;Stuck on the task? Head to the forum and ask for help!&#8221;</i> And by the way, by tips I don&#8217;t mean a whole set of complex instructions; we all know few people read the manual. By tips I mean simple to understand one line suggestions on what you should do next. For example, <i>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to replace the lance with your main weapon after you&#8217;ve completed the quest!&#8221;</i><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Challenges you care about</span></b><br /><br />While they are still many <i>&#8220;Kill n of X, so I can make Y&#8221;</i> quests in Cataclysm, you now often get quests that are more meaningful and more fun to do. For instance, one of the quests asked me to climb a tree, pick up the young bear cubs stuck in the trees, climb to the top, and toss them on a trampoline, so they can return to safety. I&#8217;ve got to admit I wanted to keep saving the cubs even after I saved the required amount for the quest!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/sJGZhp_T6xs?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/sJGZhp_T6xs?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br />What makes this quest great is that players can easily relate to the theme. You surely don&#8217;t want to leave adorable bear cubs stranded in the trees, do you? The quest isn&#8217;t just something you have to do to get more experience points, but something you want to do because you care about the bears (and because it&#8217;s fun to climb trees). <br /><br />Similarly, we&#8217;re all more willing to learn about things we care about. And we care about things that are relevant to us, about things that touch us on an emotional level. And that can be achieved by telling great stories. Not stories like <i>&#8220;Annie has 6 marbles and loses 2, how many does she have left?&#8221;</i> (who the hell is Annie and why should I care?), but stories that capture our imagination, that get us involved. How do I save the bears? Won&#8217;t they get hurt after I toss them on the trampoline? <br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Making the player feel part of something bigger</span></b><br /><br />Games have always done a great job at making players feel special. You&#8217;re the hero, the future of the world is in your hands; only you can save the princess! And WoW has always emphasized the importance of your actions through quests texts and interactions with various non-player characters in the game. But in Cataclysm, there is even more emphasis on making your storyline personalized (using <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Phasing">phasing technology</a>), especially in the starting zones that you go through as a new character.<br /><br />The experience of starting a new <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/cataclysm/features/worgen.html">worgen</a> character is a great story on its own, told over and over again for each new player. You start as a human character, helping your people defend your city, which is under attack by the savage worgen beasts. As you&#8217;re trying to get more help, you get bitten by one of the creatures, and at one point, you find yourself in jail, accused of turning wild. The world changes around you and the non-player characters help you to fill in the story of what&#8217;s going on.<br /><br />Similarly, as a high level player you are told to take a mercenary ship that will take you to one of the new continents of the expansion. While you wait for the ship to arrive, a group of Stormwind soldiers <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Quest:Call_of_Duty_(Alliance)">chatters</a> around you about the recent world events, the Cataclysm. And just by listening to the soldiers, you can learn about what&#8217;s new and about Deathwing, the dragon that is the cause of all the changes brought by Cataclysm.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FEcLfCeP4Sk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FEcLfCeP4Sk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br />It doesn&#8217;t feel like homework, like something you have to do. You just casually listen in to the conversation the characters around you are having. It feels authentic, and it makes the Cataclysm story seem more believable, more tangible. <br /><br />And a meaningful narrative is often what we fail to convey in online learning environments. We provide students with a series of resources and activities that will supposedly guide them to achieve the desired learning outcomes, but it&#8217;s usually all boring, disconnected from reality, just an endless to-do list&#8230; Well, it isn&#8217;t learning if it isn&#8217;t hard, right? Well, no, I believe there must be a way to place fun and learning in the same bag.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Being an active member of the group pays well</span></b><br /><br />Speaking of making the player feel special; Cataclysm also introduced a guild leveling system. Guilds (groups of players) now get experience points through various activities by their members. As a guild levels up, its members can get special perks and abilities. In order to use guild abilities, you have to build up your reputation with your guild by being an active player. So basically, it pays well to be loyal and active in your guild.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Guild" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TQJNp1YNijI/AAAAAAAAAos/mbHMkDtIfQI/s1600/wowguild.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>WoW Guild (source: <a href="http://www.wowcataclysm.net/">WoWCataclysm.net</a>)</i></span></div><br />Compare that to how groups usually work in our classes. Students, who do nothing, often get rewarded by choosing an active group that covers up for the inactive &#8220;player&#8221;. Sucks, right? Well, it could be fixed if we also measured a student&#8217;s &#8220;loyalty&#8221; to the group, just like in WoW. Unless you contribute enough, you just can&#8217;t get the group perks (i.e. a good grade), so you&#8217;re encouraged to play nicely with others and complete group tasks.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">But my class just can&#8217;t compete with WoW &#8230; </span></b><br /><br />I know what you might be thinking - it&#8217;s easy to talk about having fun in immersive games like WoW, but making learning fun is just too difficult. Well, guess what? Making games fun isn&#8217;t an easy job either! Good game design is both science and art that is difficult to master, and it takes tons of trials and errors to get it just right. WoW has been around since 2004 and in every expansion you can see big, gradual improvements in game design.<br /><br />So, what I&#8217;m suggesting is that we find better ways to apply the lessons learned by game designers to our online learning environments and instructional design. E-learning will probably never be as fun as playing WoW, but can&#8217;t we all just try a little harder to make learning a bit more engaging than flipping through sleep inducing &#8220;interactive&#8221; courseware, and to start telling our students meaningful stories? Perhaps we won&#8217;t be saving bear cubs in class, but there are many other missions we all care about and can teach us about what we need to know along the way.<br /><br />And it doesn&#8217;t need to be in 3D or full immersive environments. With a little imagination and clever game design I suspect we could turn our boring text-centered Learning Management Systems into Learning Experience Enabling Technology - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">LEET</a> systems. We all know many teachers are great storytellers; we just need to find a way to <i>enable</i> them to tell better stories online as well.<br /><br />Related posts:<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="/2009/03/improving-student-engagement-with-game.html">Improving student engagement with game mechanics and a smart progress bar</a></li></ul><div><br /></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/12/saving-bear-cubs-in-cataclysm-or-story.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/12/saving-bear-cubs-in-cataclysm-or-story.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

The actual news wasn&#8217;t as huge as expected - they found a bacteria living on arsenic right on our home planet - but it&#8217;s still significant because it shows how little we actually know about life and how much we tend to assume. I certainly hope the discovery encourages us to keep looking further into space and deeper into our own planet.<br /><br />More about the discovery:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2034601,00.html">Arsenic and Old Space: A Key to Life on Other Planets? - TIME</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/astrobiology_toxic_chemical.html">NASA-Funded Research Discovers Life Built With Toxic Chemical - NASA</a></li></ul><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">News: Mozilla project protects the open web and endangered species with cuteness</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/tBhfU0Cr6X0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/tBhfU0Cr6X0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;Helping the open web and the insanely adorable red pandas all at once - what&#8217;s not to like? :) Great <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2010/12/03/meet-the-newest-and-cutest-mozillians/">initiative by the Mozilla Project</a> that uses cuteness to remind us about the importance of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/biodiversity">preserving biodiversity</a> on our planet.

Sure, it&#8217;s a nice view from the window when you don&#8217;t have to go out, but snow quickly turns into an issue if you&#8217;re planning on running outdoors throughout the winter.

Not as big of a news as the NASA discovery or endangered species preservation, but nonetheless a great tool that will help me stay fit and healthy during the dark, cold winter. Staying in and being cosy is so tempting that I welcome anything that makes going out a bit easier.

We often get caught in thinking about the right and wrong ways of using tools like presentations, blogs, Twitter, and what not. Sure, it helps to know what mistakes to avoid -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/thecroaker/death-by-powerpoint">death by PowerPoint</a>&nbsp;anyone? - but that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to limit yourself to the <i>&#8220;10 rules of [insert sticky title]<insert catchy="" here="" title="">&#8221;</insert></i>.<br /><br />A great example: meet <a href="http://travisisaacs.com/">Travis Isaacs</a>, user experience designer. He uses <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a>, a presentation software, to create wireframe prototypes for websites. Wait, what?<br /><br />That&#8217;s certainly not in any rulebook or manual, but it sure works. And Travis even figured out how to turn his approach into a product (more about that on <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/12/travis-isaacs-web-design/">Mashable:&nbsp;Essential Web Design Advice From a Wireframing Master</a>).<br /><div id="__ss_4347737" style="width: 560px;"><strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 12px; text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><object height="468" id="__sse4347737" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=keynote-kung-fu-100528224132-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=keynote-kungfu-how-to-wireframe-like-a-ninja&userName=tbisaacs" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse4347737" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=keynote-kung-fu-100528224132-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=keynote-kungfu-how-to-wireframe-like-a-ninja&userName=tbisaacs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="468"></embed></object></span></strong></div><br />Somehow that reminds me of a quote from the movie&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/quotes">Pirates of The Caribbean</a>:<br /><blockquote><i><b>Elizabeth</b>: You have to take me to shore! According to the Code of the Order of the Brethren—</i></blockquote><blockquote><i><b>Barbossa</b>: First, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, so I &#8216;must&#8217; do nothing. And secondly, you must be a pirate for the Pirate&#8217;s Code to apply, and you&#8217;re not. And thirdly, the code is more what you call &#8220;guidelines&#8221; than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner!</i></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TOlKX3EbCBI/AAAAAAAAAm8/q11e338Tzjs/s1600/captain-barbossa-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="199" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TOlKX3EbCBI/AAAAAAAAAm8/q11e338Tzjs/s320/captain-barbossa-1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>So, the next time you discover a fancy list of rules for using this and that, think about whether the rules apply to you (are you a pirate or are you a ninja?) and whether it would be helpful to improvise and invent new rules.&nbsp;Think of the usual ways of using a tool as guidelines, not rules. Sometimes a little hack goes a long way!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/11/dont-be-afraid-to-break-rules.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/11/dont-be-afraid-to-break-rules.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Idea: Rethink the status quo by looking at the big picture</span></b><br /><br /><i>&#8220;Facebook to launch e-mail killer&#8221;</i> - a popular headline on tech blogs before this week&#8217;s Facebook special event dedicated to their Messages service. But luckily, Facebook didn&#8217;t listen and didn&#8217;t launch (yet another) e-mail service. They tried to think about the way we communicate in a different way. Let&#8217;s take a look at the simple idea behind the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=452288242130">new Messages with social inbox</a>:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bdzuFG6q63k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bdzuFG6q63k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b> Revolutionary design of a new product or service usually happens when you look at everything you know with a fresh perspective. It&#8217;s not about adding a long list of features, it&#8217;s not about pleasing the tech crowd. It&#8217;s about figuring out what works and what people need (not say they want). And while Facebook doesn&#8217;t always get things right, they do have the guts to think outside the box and seem to have a real passion about enabling stronger connections among friends. Kudos for that!<br /><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Idea: What are you doing to deserve the attention?</span></b><br /><br /><a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2010/11/do-i-have-your-attention-ii.html">Ewan McIntosh uses a dialog</a> from the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">The Social Network</a> to remind us that we often assume we have (or deserve) the attention of our students, colleagues, and other audiences. Let&#8217;s take a look at this great clip from the movie:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/O6aWSBSEgVk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/O6aWSBSEgVk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;Stop assuming people will listen or care about what you have to say just because you&#8217;re talking. Be prepared to earn the attention, trust and respect from your listeners. And that means not just caring about what you&#8217;re talking about, but being prepared to present your message in a way that is relevant to the listeners. Want a good case study? Head over to Danah Boyd&#8217;s blog and read about why <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/11/15/bullying-has-little-resonance-with-teenagers.html">“Bullying” Has Little Resonance with Teenagers</a>.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Blog post: Social Games are here to stay</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/19/social-gaming-mainstream/">Cracking the Mainstream: Why Social Gaming Is More Than Just a Fad |&nbsp;Mashable</a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;It&#8217;s popular to dismiss the success of social games like FarmVille as a fad. But, as <a href="http://virtualgoodsinsider.com/about/">Ravi Mehta</a> points out in his <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/19/social-gaming-mainstream/">Mashable post</a>, social games fill an important niche in the social web and are evolving with new approaches to social fun. And here&#8217;s my favorite quote from the post:<br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Throughout the history of entertainment media, content has been developed in short and long formats. Five hundred page novels, full-length feature films and television mini-series coexist harmoniously with blogs, 30-minute sitcoms and two-minute YouTube videos. Why? Because each format serves a different purpose and, without subsuming the other formats, manages to engage users in unique ways and for different reasons.&#8221;</i></blockquote><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><b>Sharable Bits</b> is a series of weekly posts that will highlight some of the most interesting bits and bytes that I stumble upon.

<i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">On Sharable Bits: I decided to start a series of weekly posts that will highlight some of the most interesting bits and bytes that I stumble upon. No bad news, just ideas that inspire, touch or entertain.</span></i><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Video: A life on Facebook</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/F2n8Ma7y4-I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/F2n8Ma7y4-I?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;A life story told through Facebook status updates. Great music, great execution, the video makes you wonder about how our lives are seen through Facebook. On a related note, it&#8217;s worth reading about why some <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/teens-find-innovative-ways-to-control-their-facebook-presence-2010-11">teens deactivate their FB accounts every time they log out</a> to keep total control of what their friends post about them.

It&#8217;s mostly commercial work for various corporate clients, but I think their approach to bringing buildings alive is just awesome. It&#8217;s great how their technology fits right in with the architecture of various building and how it adds another layer of experience to familiar object. I really hope to see/experience one of their projections live someday.<br /><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Idea: Working smarter not harder</span></b><br /><br /><a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2010/11/working-smarter-not-harder.html">Clive Shepherd reminds us</a> that working harder is not always better, what matters is working smarter. He also shares the quote by&nbsp;Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson from <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">ReWork</a>:<br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Not only is workaholism unnecessary, it’s stupid. Working more doesn’t mean you care more or get more done.

Don&#8217;t get caught into the state of super busy, in which never ending meetings, shuffling papers and e-mails keep you busy, but don&#8217;t allow you to get any real work done. Stop for a minute, think, breath, and figure out how to work smarter.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/11/sharable-bits-living-on-facebook.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/11/sharable-bits-living-on-facebook.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="81" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THUTNqMu0iI/AAAAAAAAAlM/kmlNElpGpOc/s200/evernote-logo-s.jpg" width="80" /></a></div>In the Web 2.0 era I don&#8217;t really use a lot of desktop applications anymore - everything is on the web, right? But there is one application that I just can&#8217;t imagine living without (even though you can also use it on the web): <b><a href="http://www.evernote.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #6aa84f;">Evernote</span></a></b>. <br /><br />You might have heard of Evernote before - after all, it now has over <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2010/08/17/4-million-evernoters-and-counting/">4 million (very happy) users</a>. At its hearth, Evernote is a simple note taking app that works on almost every computer, phone and mobile device out there, and can instantly sync your notes across all your devices. You can use it as a repository for all your ideas - not just in shape of simple text notes, but also as webpages, photos, audio recordings and various files. For a nice overview of the service, check out the intro video below:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LNE0R3rEe5Q?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LNE0R3rEe5Q?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="340" width="560"></embed></object></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>How can you not love a service that includes hard working cloud elephants? ;) If the video hasn&#8217;t convinced you to give Evernote a try yet, here is my list of 7 things I love about Evernote:<br /><br /><b>1) Available anywhere</b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: right;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THURO4L_nfI/AAAAAAAAAk4/KQxSH3Vvr1c/s1600/evernote-android-s.png" /></a></div>I love the fact that I always have access to Evernote, regardless of which computer or mobile device I&#8217;m using. And with the desktop version, I don&#8217;t even have to be online to work with Evernote (very useful on train trips!). Most of the time, I use the Mac OS X desktop version, but I sometimes check notes on my Android phone or iPod Touch. And yes, there&#8217;s also a Windows version, a web version and custom applications for major smartphone platforms (see the <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/">list of available downloads</a>).<br /><br /><b>2) Free for basic use</b><br /><br />Oh, did I mention it&#8217;s free? You don&#8217;t have to pay for basic use or any of the apps. But in case you need more space or want awesome features like Note history, you can go <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/premium/">Premium</a> for $5/month or $45/year. I&#8217;m still using the Free version, which has plenty of space for all my text notes, but I&#8217;m thinking of going Premium just because I find the service so useful.<br /><br /><b>3) Capture ideas, prepare them for publishing</b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/learn_more/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THUWy1IjVqI/AAAAAAAAAlU/nqaiH10-QgA/s200/evernote-note-mac-s2.png" width="200" /></a></div>With Evernote I finally have a single place to store all my ideas and little notes. No more sticky notes all over the desk, no more .txt files on the desktop, just one app. And I also find it great for transforming ideas I collect into drafts that I can move to blogs, text editing software etc. for final design and publishing. And yes, I also wrote the draft for this post in Evernote and only moved it to Blogger when it was nearly finished. I really prefer to write in the simple, clutter free Evernote window - I usually double click the note I&#8217;m working on and leave just that note window open.<br /><br /><b>4) Easy sync </b><br /><br />I always use Evernote to take notes on my laptop during meetings. No more wasted paper and illegible hand written notes! And if you still need to draw something on paper or whiteboard, you can just take a picture of that and add it to your Evernote meeting note. The best part is getting home&nbsp;after meetings to find the latest notes already waiting for me on my desktop computer. In other words, no extra time needed to sort and read through notes, as I can start working right within Evernote.<br /><br /><b>5) Image recognition in the cloud</b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/learn_more/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THUT5uyH2wI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/EjY45qRG8dw/s1600/organizeit_art_global.png" /></a></div>The cool part is that Evernote is not just a simple backup service for notes. In fact, the Evernote elephants in the cloud also do image recognition on any photos you add, so that it&#8217;s easier for you to find your stuff. You can for instance use Evernote to scan and save images of business cards and Evernote makes sure all the text becomes searchable.<br /><br /><b>6) Different ways to search and sort</b><br /><br />There are many different ways to sort notes in Evernote. I like to create new notebooks for major projects or areas of interests, and you can use tags to sort your notes even further. I must admit I&#8217;m pretty sloppy when it comes to using tags, but that&#8217;s ok - Evernote doesn&#8217;t mind that, and helps me find what I&#8217;m looking for through Search.<br /><br /><b>7) The magic Evernote Trunk</b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/trunk/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THUR-khMvqI/AAAAAAAAAlE/ruTE-3uyxAo/s200/evernotetrunk.jpg" width="180" /></a></div>And if you&#8217;re looking for ways to improve Evernote, look no further than into the <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/trunk/">Evernote Trunk</a>! The Trunk, also accessible from the desktop applications, is basically a showcase of apps that work with Evernote and can enhance your Evernote experience. The Trunk has only been <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2010/07/14/the-evernote-trunk/">launched</a> this summer, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing more apps added in the future.<br /><br /><b>Nearly perfect for remembering everything</b><br /><br />The only two feature requests I have for Evernote are better sharing/collaboration options within the desktop app and color coding for notes. But other than that, I really think Evernote is a great product that is simple, yet incredibly flexible and usable in all sorts of situations.<br /><br />So, if you&#8217;re not using Evernote yet, I suggest you give it a try and see how it works for you. Keep in mind that there is no right or wrong way to use it - be creative and start adding your ideas in any format into your digital notebooks.
