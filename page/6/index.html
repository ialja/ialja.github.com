And as someone with several vision problems, I pay extra attention to what we can do to protect our vision. The <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/25/eye-health/">blog post</a> provides great starting tips, especially the one about taking regular breaks and remembering to blink (sounds obvious, but it isn&#8217;t when you are engaged in an epic game battle or get caught in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>).

Always handy to have such lists ready when talking to technology skeptics, who think of anything digital as pure evil. Especially with the media habit of presenting the digital risks before the benefits. The recent NYTimes article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/technology/21brain.html">Growing Up Digital, Wired for Distraction</a>&nbsp;does explore both sides, but the headline is still all about distraction.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
We often get caught in thinking about the right and wrong ways of using tools like presentations, blogs, Twitter, and what not. Sure, it helps to know what mistakes to avoid -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/thecroaker/death-by-powerpoint">death by PowerPoint</a>&nbsp;anyone? - but that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to limit yourself to the <i>&#8220;10 rules of [insert sticky title]<insert catchy="" here="" title="">&#8221;</insert></i>.<br /><br />A great example: meet <a href="http://travisisaacs.com/">Travis Isaacs</a>, user experience designer. He uses <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a>, a presentation software, to create wireframe prototypes for websites. Wait, what?<br /><br />That&#8217;s certainly not in any rulebook or manual, but it sure works. And Travis even figured out how to turn his approach into a product (more about that on <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/12/travis-isaacs-web-design/">Mashable:&nbsp;Essential Web Design Advice From a Wireframing Master</a>).<br /><div id="__ss_4347737" style="width: 560px;"><strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 12px; text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><object height="468" id="__sse4347737" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=keynote-kung-fu-100528224132-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=keynote-kungfu-how-to-wireframe-like-a-ninja&userName=tbisaacs" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse4347737" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=keynote-kung-fu-100528224132-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=keynote-kungfu-how-to-wireframe-like-a-ninja&userName=tbisaacs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="468"></embed></object></span></strong></div><br />Somehow that reminds me of a quote from the movie&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/quotes">Pirates of The Caribbean</a>:<br /><blockquote><i><b>Elizabeth</b>: You have to take me to shore! According to the Code of the Order of the Brethren—</i></blockquote><blockquote><i><b>Barbossa</b>: First, your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, so I &#8216;must&#8217; do nothing. And secondly, you must be a pirate for the Pirate&#8217;s Code to apply, and you&#8217;re not. And thirdly, the code is more what you call &#8220;guidelines&#8221; than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner!</i></blockquote><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TOlKX3EbCBI/AAAAAAAAAm8/q11e338Tzjs/s1600/captain-barbossa-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="199" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TOlKX3EbCBI/AAAAAAAAAm8/q11e338Tzjs/s320/captain-barbossa-1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>So, the next time you discover a fancy list of rules for using this and that, think about whether the rules apply to you (are you a pirate or are you a ninja?) and whether it would be helpful to improvise and invent new rules.&nbsp;Think of the usual ways of using a tool as guidelines, not rules. Sometimes a little hack goes a long way!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/11/dont-be-afraid-to-break-rules.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/11/dont-be-afraid-to-break-rules.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Idea: Rethink the status quo by looking at the big picture</span></b><br /><br /><i>&#8220;Facebook to launch e-mail killer&#8221;</i> - a popular headline on tech blogs before this week&#8217;s Facebook special event dedicated to their Messages service. But luckily, Facebook didn&#8217;t listen and didn&#8217;t launch (yet another) e-mail service. They tried to think about the way we communicate in a different way. Let&#8217;s take a look at the simple idea behind the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=452288242130">new Messages with social inbox</a>:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bdzuFG6q63k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bdzuFG6q63k?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b> Revolutionary design of a new product or service usually happens when you look at everything you know with a fresh perspective. It&#8217;s not about adding a long list of features, it&#8217;s not about pleasing the tech crowd. It&#8217;s about figuring out what works and what people need (not say they want). And while Facebook doesn&#8217;t always get things right, they do have the guts to think outside the box and seem to have a real passion about enabling stronger connections among friends. Kudos for that!<br /><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Idea: What are you doing to deserve the attention?</span></b><br /><br /><a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2010/11/do-i-have-your-attention-ii.html">Ewan McIntosh uses a dialog</a> from the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">The Social Network</a> to remind us that we often assume we have (or deserve) the attention of our students, colleagues, and other audiences. Let&#8217;s take a look at this great clip from the movie:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/O6aWSBSEgVk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/O6aWSBSEgVk?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;Stop assuming people will listen or care about what you have to say just because you&#8217;re talking. Be prepared to earn the attention, trust and respect from your listeners. And that means not just caring about what you&#8217;re talking about, but being prepared to present your message in a way that is relevant to the listeners. Want a good case study? Head over to Danah Boyd&#8217;s blog and read about why <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/11/15/bullying-has-little-resonance-with-teenagers.html">“Bullying” Has Little Resonance with Teenagers</a>.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Blog post: Social Games are here to stay</span></b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/19/social-gaming-mainstream/">Cracking the Mainstream: Why Social Gaming Is More Than Just a Fad |&nbsp;Mashable</a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;It&#8217;s popular to dismiss the success of social games like FarmVille as a fad. But, as <a href="http://virtualgoodsinsider.com/about/">Ravi Mehta</a> points out in his <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/19/social-gaming-mainstream/">Mashable post</a>, social games fill an important niche in the social web and are evolving with new approaches to social fun. And here&#8217;s my favorite quote from the post:<br /><blockquote><i>&#8220;Throughout the history of entertainment media, content has been developed in short and long formats. Five hundred page novels, full-length feature films and television mini-series coexist harmoniously with blogs, 30-minute sitcoms and two-minute YouTube videos. Why? Because each format serves a different purpose and, without subsuming the other formats, manages to engage users in unique ways and for different reasons.&#8221;</i></blockquote><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><b>Sharable Bits</b> is a series of weekly posts that will highlight some of the most interesting bits and bytes that I stumble upon.

Great music, great execution, the video makes you wonder about how our lives are seen through Facebook. On a related note, it&#8217;s worth reading about why some <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/teens-find-innovative-ways-to-control-their-facebook-presence-2010-11">teens deactivate their FB accounts every time they log out</a> to keep total control of what their friends post about them.

It&#8217;s mostly commercial work for various corporate clients, but I think their approach to bringing buildings alive is just awesome. It&#8217;s great how their technology fits right in with the architecture of various building and how it adds another layer of experience to familiar object. I really hope to see/experience one of their projections live someday.<br /><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Idea: Working smarter not harder</span></b><br /><br /><a href="http://clive-shepherd.blogspot.com/2010/11/working-smarter-not-harder.html">Clive Shepherd reminds us</a> that working harder is not always better, what matters is working smarter.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="81" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THUTNqMu0iI/AAAAAAAAAlM/kmlNElpGpOc/s200/evernote-logo-s.jpg" width="80" /></a></div>In the Web 2.0 era I don&#8217;t really use a lot of desktop applications anymore - everything is on the web, right? But there is one application that I just can&#8217;t imagine living without (even though you can also use it on the web): <b><a href="http://www.evernote.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #6aa84f;">Evernote</span></a></b>. <br /><br />You might have heard of Evernote before - after all, it now has over <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2010/08/17/4-million-evernoters-and-counting/">4 million (very happy) users</a>. At its hearth, Evernote is a simple note taking app that works on almost every computer, phone and mobile device out there, and can instantly sync your notes across all your devices. You can use it as a repository for all your ideas - not just in shape of simple text notes, but also as webpages, photos, audio recordings and various files. For a nice overview of the service, check out the intro video below:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/LNE0R3rEe5Q?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/LNE0R3rEe5Q?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="340" width="560"></embed></object></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>How can you not love a service that includes hard working cloud elephants? ;) If the video hasn&#8217;t convinced you to give Evernote a try yet, here is my list of 7 things I love about Evernote:<br /><br /><b>1) Available anywhere</b><br /><br /><div style="text-align: right;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THURO4L_nfI/AAAAAAAAAk4/KQxSH3Vvr1c/s1600/evernote-android-s.png" /></a></div>I love the fact that I always have access to Evernote, regardless of which computer or mobile device I&#8217;m using. And with the desktop version, I don&#8217;t even have to be online to work with Evernote (very useful on train trips!). Most of the time, I use the Mac OS X desktop version, but I sometimes check notes on my Android phone or iPod Touch. And yes, there&#8217;s also a Windows version, a web version and custom applications for major smartphone platforms (see the <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/">list of available downloads</a>).<br /><br /><b>2) Free for basic use</b><br /><br />Oh, did I mention it&#8217;s free? You don&#8217;t have to pay for basic use or any of the apps. But in case you need more space or want awesome features like Note history, you can go <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/premium/">Premium</a> for $5/month or $45/year. I&#8217;m still using the Free version, which has plenty of space for all my text notes, but I&#8217;m thinking of going Premium just because I find the service so useful.<br /><br /><b>3) Capture ideas, prepare them for publishing</b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/learn_more/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THUWy1IjVqI/AAAAAAAAAlU/nqaiH10-QgA/s200/evernote-note-mac-s2.png" width="200" /></a></div>With Evernote I finally have a single place to store all my ideas and little notes. No more sticky notes all over the desk, no more .txt files on the desktop, just one app. And I also find it great for transforming ideas I collect into drafts that I can move to blogs, text editing software etc. for final design and publishing. And yes, I also wrote the draft for this post in Evernote and only moved it to Blogger when it was nearly finished. I really prefer to write in the simple, clutter free Evernote window - I usually double click the note I&#8217;m working on and leave just that note window open.<br /><br /><b>4) Easy sync </b><br /><br />I always use Evernote to take notes on my laptop during meetings. No more wasted paper and illegible hand written notes! And if you still need to draw something on paper or whiteboard, you can just take a picture of that and add it to your Evernote meeting note. The best part is getting home&nbsp;after meetings to find the latest notes already waiting for me on my desktop computer. In other words, no extra time needed to sort and read through notes, as I can start working right within Evernote.<br /><br /><b>5) Image recognition in the cloud</b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/learn_more/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THUT5uyH2wI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/EjY45qRG8dw/s1600/organizeit_art_global.png" /></a></div>The cool part is that Evernote is not just a simple backup service for notes. In fact, the Evernote elephants in the cloud also do image recognition on any photos you add, so that it&#8217;s easier for you to find your stuff. You can for instance use Evernote to scan and save images of business cards and Evernote makes sure all the text becomes searchable.<br /><br /><b>6) Different ways to search and sort</b><br /><br />There are many different ways to sort notes in Evernote. I like to create new notebooks for major projects or areas of interests, and you can use tags to sort your notes even further. I must admit I&#8217;m pretty sloppy when it comes to using tags, but that&#8217;s ok - Evernote doesn&#8217;t mind that, and helps me find what I&#8217;m looking for through Search.<br /><br /><b>7) The magic Evernote Trunk</b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/trunk/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/THUR-khMvqI/AAAAAAAAAlE/ruTE-3uyxAo/s200/evernotetrunk.jpg" width="180" /></a></div>And if you&#8217;re looking for ways to improve Evernote, look no further than into the <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/trunk/">Evernote Trunk</a>! The Trunk, also accessible from the desktop applications, is basically a showcase of apps that work with Evernote and can enhance your Evernote experience. The Trunk has only been <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2010/07/14/the-evernote-trunk/">launched</a> this summer, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing more apps added in the future.<br /><br /><b>Nearly perfect for remembering everything</b><br /><br />The only two feature requests I have for Evernote are better sharing/collaboration options within the desktop app and color coding for notes. But other than that, I really think Evernote is a great product that is simple, yet incredibly flexible and usable in all sorts of situations.<br /><br />So, if you&#8217;re not using Evernote yet, I suggest you give it a try and see how it works for you. Keep in mind that there is no right or wrong way to use it - be creative and start adding your ideas in any format into your digital notebooks. And if you&#8217;re looking for new ideas on how to use Evernote, check out the <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/category/tips_stories/">Tips and Stories section</a>&nbsp;on the Evernote blog.<br /><br />If you&#8217;ve got any good Evernote tips, let me know in the comments!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/08/7-things-i-love-about-evernote.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/08/7-things-i-love-about-evernote.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

For this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/course/view.php?id=15">4th International Slovenian MoodleMoot</a> I decided to explore the efforts being made to bring Moodle to mobile devices. I found several interesting projects in this field, although I think we&#8217;re just starting to explore all possibilities, and that more interesting developments will follow in the next few years, especially when teachers start experimenting with things like geolocation, augmented reality and resources that can interact with sensors on mobile devices.<br /><br />The main goal of my paper and presentation was to invite teachers to think about possibilities that mobile devices can offer for education and the ways we could embed mobile learning in Moodle, a well established Learning Management System.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s the abstract from my paper <b>Taking Moodle Out of the Classroom: Making Learning Mobile, Context-Aware and Fun</b>:<br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #0b5394;">&#8220;Mobile devices are becoming increasingly more powerful, better connected and are able to provide better user experience and new services based around location and context of users, which opens new possibilities for learning. The paper presents an overview of mobile learning and the efforts being made to provide better support for mobile devices and learning activities/resources in Moodle. In conclusion we also present some future trends in mobile computing that could also provide new ways of learning on the go.&#8221;</span></i><br /><br />You can see a video of my presentation at the conference on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEU-6w3VhOU">YouTube</a> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">(total length 15 min)</span>:<br /><br /><object height="340" width="560"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YEU-6w3VhOU&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YEU-6w3VhOU&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br />And if you&#8217;d like to learn more about the topic, you can read my full paper on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/31765265/Taking-Moodle-Out-of-the-Classroom-Making-Learning-Mobile-Context-Aware-and-Fun">Scribd</a>:<br /><br /><object data="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf" height="600" id="doc_734036138548940" name="doc_734036138548940" style="outline: none;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560">  <param name="movie" value="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><param name="FlashVars" value="document_id=31765265&access_key=key-1jqleqk19b0srysfs3bo&page=1&viewMode=list"><embed id="doc_734036138548940" name="doc_734036138548940" src="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf?document_id=31765265&access_key=key-1jqleqk19b0srysfs3bo&page=1&viewMode=list" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="600" width="560" wmode="opaque" bgcolor="#ffffff"></embed>  </object><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/05/imagining-mobile-moodle.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/05/imagining-mobile-moodle.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
With the arrival of <a href="http://www.eyetoy.com/">Eye Toy</a> for Playstation 2, the widely popular <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/">Nintendo Wii</a>, and the upcoming release of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/projectnatal/">Project Natal</a> for Xbox, the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exergaming">exergaming</a> - the use of video games as a form of exercise - has started gaining popularity. But how effective are these games? Can you really get fit by playing, let&#8217;s say, Wii Sports?<br /><br />It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve embarked on a quest to find the best exergame aka geek friendly exercise, and throughout the course of my journey I&#8217;ve tried out many different games (mainly on Playstation 2 and Nintendo Wii), so I thought I&#8217;d do a little overview of what you can expect to gain from different types of exergames. <br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #6aa84f;">Casual Exergames: Lots of Fun with Friends</span></b><br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Examples: Wii Sports, Mario Cart Wii</span></i><br /><br /><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/1OTtO06SP7M52gi5m8pD6CnahbW8CzxE" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-right: 7px;" title="Wii Sports"><img border="0" height="141" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S-l6QdIncbI/AAAAAAAAAkM/rd8wH6umwlA/s200/Wii_Sports_Europe.jpg" width="100" /></a>Most Wii games fall into this category and I would also include games supposedly more focused on exercise, like <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/1OTtO06SP7M52gi5m8pD6CnahbW8CzxE">Wii Sports</a>. These games count on a limited amount of moves, and you don&#8217;t even have to invest a lot of effort into the right moves to make it through the game. The focus is on fun rather than burning calories and these games usually won&#8217;t hold your attention for long.<br /><br />So, don&#8217;t be fooled by the Sports in the title; these games won&#8217;t really prepare you for any real sport, but the plus side is that they really are a lot of fun to play when you&#8217;re having friends over!<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #f1c232;">Medium Intensity Exergames: Balancing Fun and Exercise</span></b><br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Examples: Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), Eye Toy Kinetic, We Cheer, Wii Fit</span></i><br /><br /><a href="http://www.wecheergame.com/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-right: 7px;" title="We Cheer 2 (Wii)"><img border="0" height="141" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S-l7b4qFQ8I/AAAAAAAAAkQ/LAATrxkPMCg/s200/We_Cheer_2.jpg" width="100" /></a>The games in this category can be quite demanding, especially if played on higher difficult levels, although they sometimes don&#8217;t get your whole body moving (for instance, <a href="http://www.wecheergame.com/">We Cheer</a> is mostly a good exercise for your arms). But be prepared to spend a lot of time navigating menus, choosing exercises, songs and what not. Also, be prepared to invest some time in making sure your moves are detected properly, which can be quite frustrating and can spoil your immersion in the game. However, if everything works fine, these games provide a lot of fun and some exercise, but a lot of time is lost on pointless tasks (and if you&#8217;re out of luck, a cumbersome navigation through menus).<br /><br />The bottom line is: if you invest enough energy in these games, they can make you sweat, but you have to play these games a whole lot (read: at least an hour per session) before getting any real results. <br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">High Intensity Exergames: Emphasizing Exercise</span></b><br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Examples: My Fitness Coach (Wii)</span></i><br /><br /><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/4g1xoYv-pBuBjGBqCS-nGN1GKR4OLQEc" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-right: 7px;" title="My Fitness Coach (Wii)"><img border="0" height="141" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S-l8WpwK2fI/AAAAAAAAAkU/_J5vdfK02Tg/s200/My_Fitness_Coach.jpg" width="100" /></a>Interestingly enough, the highest intensity exergame I found for the Wii doesn&#8217;t even use the motion sensing abilities of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote">Wiimote</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Board">Wii Balance Board</a>. It&#8217;s just a continuos exercise routine that really gets you moving around. It&#8217;s up to you to make sure you&#8217;re doing the right thing, but if you&#8217;re interested in getting fit, you should have the motivation for that anyway. What I like about <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/4g1xoYv-pBuBjGBqCS-nGN1GKR4OLQEc">My Fitness Coach</a> is that you only have to choose the duration and daily focus of your workout, and everything else is done for you. No wasting time on menus, you&#8217;re just asked to assess the difficulty of the workout after completing major sections, so that the next workouts can be adjusted accordingly.&nbsp;A great feature is also that you are asked to do a Physical Challenge every 10 workouts, so you can really track how your workout affects different parts of your body.<br /><br />All in all, My Fitness Coach is a real exercise that will can have real effects on your fitness level if you decide to stick with it. And it&#8217;s a nice way to get prepared for more difficult forms of exercise if you&#8217;re starting from scratch.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cc0000;">Leaving the Game Consoles: Nothing Beats the Real Deal</span></b><br /><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Examples: Nike+</span></i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-right: 7px;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/S-mDjXt09KI/AAAAAAAAAkc/S4S6D8q3k78/s1600/Nike+iPod.png" /></a></div>Not surprisingly, at the end of my exergame journey I came to the conclusion that nothing beats the real deal: going out and running. But as a true geek I wasn&#8217;t prepared to settle for a workout without gadgets, so I decided to give <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/">Nike+ iPod Sports Kit</a> a try. While it&#8217;s not a true exergame, it&#8217;s a great gadget that can keep you motivated and provides real-time feedback during your runs. After every run, I love to see how the latest run compares to previous ones, compete in different online challenges with or against other runners and set personal goals to beat.<br /><br />As you can see from <a href="http://my.nike.com/Altaya">my profile</a>, I haven&#8217;t been using Nike+ for long, but I find it very easy to decide to go for a run after seeing how close I am to a goal or how other runners are beating my distance.&nbsp;Nike+&nbsp;brings elements of games to real exercise and that I think is the winning combination.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">Exergames: Easy Start and a Filler Activity</span></span><br /><br />So, what exactly is the role of exergames then? Are they worth it?<br /><br />If you&#8217;re looking for something that will help you to get up from the couch, I&#8217;d suggest starting with some of the Medium Intensity Exergames I listed and then progress to Higher Intensity or outdoor activities. Having fun can really make you appreciate exercise and I found less intensive games like Wii Fit to be a great way to get used to regular workouts, but you&#8217;ll probably soon feel the desire to progress to something more demanding (especially if you want visible results).<br /><br />Apart from providing an easy start, exergames can also provide you with an exercise option on days when you feel like taking a little break, but still want to workout. For example,&nbsp;my current workout routine includes Nike+ running around 3 times a week and My Fitness Coach in between to strengthen specific body muscles. And when I just feel like having fun, a dose of We Cheer can also provide some light exercise.<br /><br />To sum it up: exergames do have some positive effects, but don&#8217;t rely on exergames alone to get fit. I can certainly recommend using them as a fun way to encourage and maintain regular exercise - but don&#8217;t forget that there are also gadgets like Nike+ that can make serious outdoor activity more enjoyable.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/05/having-fun-and-getting-fit-overview-of.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2010/05/having-fun-and-getting-fit-overview-of.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
