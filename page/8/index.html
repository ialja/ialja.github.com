<a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> is a great open source and freely available online learning management system, but what really makes it special is the large community of teachers and administrators that are using it in many different and innovative ways. And that is why Moodle conferences called <span style="font-weight: bold;">MoodleMoots</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(</span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://moodlemoot.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=11">gatherings of wise Moodle users</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">)</span> are always great events to attend for anyone already using Moodle or trying to learn more about it. They are a great opportunity for people to share best practices and to find new connections and even friendships.<br /><br />And it is with great pleasure that I&#8217;m now helping organize the <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/course/view.php?id=12">3rd International Slovenian MoodleMoot</a>, which will take place on May 22nd in the lovely and sunny coastal city of <a href="http://www.turizemvkopru.com/">Koper</a>, <a href="http://www.slovenia.info/?lng=2">Slovenia</a> <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(my birth place!)</span>. I would like to invite you all to attend our Moot and present your experience with Moodle; and if you can&#8217;t make the trip to Koper, you can even present remotely via Skype. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about our MoodleMoot, see the official <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=163">Call for International Presentations</a>.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/course/view.php?id=12"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 242px; height: 170px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Scd8f1jJ1rI/AAAAAAAAAYk/CTVJuKc2_y4/s320/MoodleMoot09+ENG.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5316354771526473394" border="0" /></a>In case the timing of our conference isn&#8217;t right for you, I&#8217;d also like to encourage you to take a look at <a href="http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=33">the list of other MoodleMoots</a> that are being organized all over the world.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Keeping students motivated and interested can often be challenging; even more so when you&#8217;re dealing with distance learning. There are of course several pedagogical approaches that we can use to keep students motivated, but lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about how we could make the tools that we already use in education more student friendly, more engaging and fun to use. And here&#8217;s an idea I&#8217;ve been playing with in my mind lately: the integration of smart progress bars into a LMS (Learning Management System) to increase student engagement.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Progress bars on the web - nothing new</span><br /><br />I&#8217;ve noticed that several websites are using progress bars to encourage users to fill out their profiles. You&#8217;ve probably seen this on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> and even in various tutorials. Another thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that these progress bars really work on me! Every time I see one of these I try to increase the level of completeness; I admit that it even convinced me to give out my e-mail address to a Facebook app! What is great about these progress bars is that they usually suggest the next step you should take to increase the completeness. <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Want more? Add this box to your profile!&#8221;</span> It&#8217;s simple, easy to follow, and you get something new to do each time.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SbopYIrYUnI/AAAAAAAAAX0/V70jQmZm9to/s1600-h/linkedin-progress-bar.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5312604205059953266" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SbopYIrYUnI/AAAAAAAAAX0/V70jQmZm9to/s400/linkedin-progress-bar.png" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 117px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></a><span style="color: #999999; font-style: italic;">LinkedIn profile completeness</span></div>It&#8217;s also common to show some kind of progress bars in learning activities such as online lessons. You&#8217;ve probably seen this too: <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;You&#8217;ve completed 80% of this lesson&#8221;</span>. Unfortunately, these progress indicators are often way too impersonal too provide anything else than plain information. And this can be quite boring. You know in advance that all you have to do is keep clicking the Next button and you&#8217;ll eventually get to the end.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Integrating progress bars with smart suggestions into a LMS</span><br /><br />Now, what if we would try to integrate the interesting type of progress bars in e-learning courses? I&#8217;m thinking about some sort of course-wide (and even site-wide) progress indicators. Let me explain what I mean.<br /><br />You have an online course, and you&#8217;re using a LMS; let&#8217;s say <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> <span style="color: #999999;">(the LMS I&#8217;m most familiar with)</span>. And you have a set of activities students have to complete. Your LMS allows you to group these activities by weeks or topics. Now you also have a tool that allows you to set the connections between activities. For example, a student should first read the introductory article, then discuss it on the forums, and at the end of the week write a blog post about the subject or make a podcast about it. And let&#8217;s also say that you could define a set of activities that have to be completed to unlock the next section.<br /><br />Now, imagine a block that would show each student how much of the activities have been completed or how many points the student has accumulated in the current week/topic. At the bottom of the block there is a link that says: <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Well done Lucy, you&#8217;ve completed 80% of this week activities! Click here to find out what else you can do this week.&#8221;</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Great job Lucy, you&#8217;ve earned 80% of the available points for this topic! Click here to find what you can do next to get that perfect score!&#8221;</span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SboqH-ehOWI/AAAAAAAAAX8/VrJdIjWpi7A/s1600-h/progress-bar-moodle.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5312605026955376994" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SboqH-ehOWI/AAAAAAAAAX8/VrJdIjWpi7A/s400/progress-bar-moodle.png" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 175px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 254px;" /></a><span style="color: #999999; font-style: italic;">A sample Moodle block with a progress bar</span></div>After clicking the link, our student, Lucy, gets a list of activities that she hasn&#8217;t completed yet or that she can improve. It&#8217;s not necessary to show all activities; the LMS only shows activities that make sense for Lucy at that time. Just a few of activities that Lucy can do next. If we want to get really smart, we could even suggest activities that best suit Lucy&#8217;s learning style. Let&#8217;s say we know that Lucy likes doing podcasts, but hates writing. In this case, the LMS would just suggest Lucy to do a podcast, and leave the option of blogging out <span style="color: #999999;">(Lucy could of course change her preferences at any time and choose from a full set of activities)</span>.<br /><br />At any time in the course, Lucy can also get the info about how successful she was in previous weeks/topics and have a look at the course overall progress bar. To make things more interesting for Lucy, we focus on the overall course goal, and <span style="font-style: italic;">reward</span> her each time she completes one with activity with another activity that bring her closer to achieving the overall goal. Lucy is also getting curious about what kind of activities she&#8217;ll get to do after she completes the current section. She knows her teacher always find interesting things to read and do. And you know what? I also think Lucy has been a good student so far, so she certainly deserves a special reward each time she completes a section of activities. We can display another star next to her name, and this week she also made it on our list of top students! <span style="font-style: italic;">Hurray Lucy! You&#8217;re so close to becoming the master of the course and </span><a href="http://lostgarden.com/2008/10/princess-rescuing-application-slides.html" style="font-style: italic;">save the princess</a><span style="font-style: italic;">!</span><br /><br />Ah yes, these are all well known game mechanics, but we&#8217;re currently not doing a very good job at implementing them in education, so why don&#8217;t we try do engage Lucy by giving her a clear sense of achievement in each course she&#8217;s taking? And if Lucy is doing really well, we might even give her the option to tell her Facebook friends about how good she is by allowing her to export some of this info into her Facebook stream.<br /><br />The same principle could also be implemented site-wide. For example, upon login in her school&#8217;s LMS, Lucy can see how much of the activities she completed in the current semester/year/program and receive suggestions on what activities she should do next - across different courses. If we want to get really, really smart, we can let Lucy tell us how much time she has available and suggest an activity that she can do in that amount of time or let&#8217;s try to guess which subject would most suit Lucy on a Monday morning! And again, we can also take into account her learning style preferences or even what we know about her past behaviors.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Should we do it?</span><br /><br />Showing students exactly where they are and what their next steps can/should be is very important. And I think that progress bars and smart suggestions could provide an interesting motivational tool and a powerful way to help students organize their study and follow the progress of their study or a course.<br /><br />Technically speaking, integrating the progress bar in a LMS course or site shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult. It might get a bit more tricky to develop a really smart suggestion system, so I don&#8217;t expect to see that one soon. Right now, I&#8217;d really be happy just with a smart and personalized progress bar :)<br /><br />Now, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of individual online activities that provide some sort of progress bar and feedback <span style="color: #999999;">(for instance, the Moodle Lesson module)</span>, but I haven&#8217;t yet come across any LMS that would provide this for the entire course or site and that would allow teachers to easily and precisely define the flow of different types of course activities. And I also haven&#8217;t seen any smart suggestion systems for learning activities. Am I missing something or is this something that hasn&#8217;t been done yet? Is anyone up to the challenge of implementing the described game mechanics into our courses? Let me know!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/03/improving-student-engagement-with-game.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/03/improving-student-engagement-with-game.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I recently celebrated my birthday, and one of the most memorable greetings came from quite an unexpected source: the business social networking site <a href="http://www.xing.com/">Xing</a>. I received an e-mail informing me that they are giving me 10 days of Premium Membership. That in itself is a nice touch, but what really brought a smile to my face was the picture of a Xing cake with my name on it that was attached to the message.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SbVhmeqSVdI/AAAAAAAAAXk/oyJfRVESZ7s/s1600-h/xing+cake.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 256px; height: 278px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SbVhmeqSVdI/AAAAAAAAAXk/oyJfRVESZ7s/s320/xing+cake.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5311258649246717394" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">My own virtual cake!

But still; Xing took the time to think of a special way to wish their members a happy birthday, and it certainly worked for me. I confess that I don&#8217;t even use Xing regularly, but this simple gestures has increased my appreciation for the site. An unexpected and original display of affection can certainly go a long way. Can you remember when was the last time you tried to do something different, unexpected, something personal for your customers/students/friends?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/03/little-attention-goes-long-way.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/03/little-attention-goes-long-way.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
When I talk about social media I often mention the fact that my grandpa has a blog. Well, actually two blogs: one for his <a href="http://gmdkoper.blogspot.com/">local mycological society</a> and the other for his <a href="http://dusemedela.blogspot.com/">local pensioner organisation</a>. It all started when his mycological society wanted a website where they could post news and announcements. I told him I would set up a website where he could post his own news. And that was it. I also created a short manual with a few annotated screenshots of the Blogger interface, so that it would be easier for him to start. And now he rarely needs my help with his two blogs; he writes and tags his posts, adds pictures from various events, and even gets an occasional comment from his peers.<br /><br />Why am I writing about this? I think this is a good example of how sometimes there is no need for getting too involved with the specifics of a technology we want to adopt (or convince others to adopt). My grandpa doesn&#8217;t need to know what social media or blogging is and he doesn&#8217;t even need to understand how hyperlinks work because he mainly writes about real life events nobody else is blogging about. He had a need and I helped him to find the right tool for the job and provided what he needed to start. And that&#8217;s where we should all start when thinking about new technologies: with the need they can help us fulfill. The tools are usually not the problem anymore. So don&#8217;t be tempted to make web 2.0 (or any other shiny new technology) about buzzwords or about technical specifications. Web 2.0 is a web that enables people to share experiences easily and more effectively, and Web 2.0 is for me a web where my grandpa is a blogger.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/02/my-grandpa-is-blogger-and-doesnt-even.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/02/my-grandpa-is-blogger-and-doesnt-even.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yes, it certainly has been a while since I last posted on this blog. I can easily think of several reasons for this: finding micro blogging easier for sharing quick ideas and cool content, having the feeling that what I have to say has already been written more eloquently somewhere else, not finishing drafts, spending more time writing a <a href="http://www.artesia.si/category/tags/spotlight">newsletter</a> for my company, dealing with health problems, struggling with finding the right direction and voice for this blog&#8230; and probably much more. But that&#8217;s not really what I want to talk about today.<br /><br />I started this blog as a personal exploration of this new medium and perhaps it&#8217;s best to keep it this way. It&#8217;s just one of the many channels I use to communicate with the world and right now I have no desire to have this blog as my main channel. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not writing this post to promise to blog more regularly or to keep this blog in a certain direction. And neither am I giving up on this blog completely. I might post again tomorrow, next month or even next year; the thing is that I just don&#8217;t want to worry about that anymore. I never considered myself a blogger anyway; right now I&#8217;m just somebody who enjoys writing blog posts once in a while, and I think I do a better job at sharing interesting content through my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/11345071552136029281">Google Reader shared items </a>or on <a href="http://ialja.tumblr.com/">my recently revived tumblelog</a>.<br /><br />So, I guess I just wanted to make an announcement that this blog isn&#8217;t quite dead yet, but at the same time admit that I really have no idea of what you can expect here. All I can do is to invite you to keep watching this space and watch its journey with me. Who knows, we might find something interesting along the way :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/02/in-case-youve-been-wondering.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2009/02/in-case-youve-been-wondering.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Today I have the pleasure to invite you all to attend or present at the upcoming <a href="http://www.moodle.si/moodle/course/view.php?id=10">Slovenian MoodleMoot</a>. Some of you may remember me writing about <a href="/2007/05/report-first-slovenian-moodle-moot.html">last year&#8217;s</a> (first) Slovenian Moodle conference, but the big change this year is that we&#8217;re making the conference more international and more accessible to a wider audience. We will be in fact broadcasting the international section of the conference live in <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> and we&#8217;re also looking for international presenters that are willing to present their experience with <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> or <a href="http://sloodle.org/">Sloodle</a> to the Slovenian and Second Life audience through Second Life. The combination of physical and virtual presentations will be the first of its kind for everyone involved, so I hope we can get the technology to cooperate ;)<br /><br />And here&#8217;s more info about the conference and about how international guests and presenters can get involved:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SDQdo7RRGNI/AAAAAAAAAO0/i0Kw8GR5ER0/s1600-h/MoodleMoot+SLO+2008.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 174px; height: 113px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/SDQdo7RRGNI/AAAAAAAAAO0/i0Kw8GR5ER0/s320/MoodleMoot+SLO+2008.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5202816058461853906" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><b>When: June 6th, 2008<br />Where: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koper" title="Koper" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" class="zem_slink">Koper</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia" title="Slovenia" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" class="zem_slink">Slovenia</a>; Second Life®<br />Deadline for application: May 31st, 2008<br />Contact info: <a href="mailto:cei@fm-kp.si?subject=MoodleMoot%202008">cei@fm-kp.si</a><br /><br /></b><b><span style="color: rgb(42, 52, 127);">About the conference<br /><br /></span></b>Last year the Faculty of Management decided to host the first Slovenian Moodle conference (also known as a MoodleMoot) to bring together users, developers and administrators of Moodle, one of the most popular online learning management systems in Slovenia.

The 2nd Slovenian MoodleMoot will feature several presentations from Slovenian users, but also a real life and a virtual international section in English.
