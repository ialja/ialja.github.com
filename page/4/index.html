  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8O0Q89XOahI/TXYKd-s7kZI/AAAAAAAAAuQ/E3u6RgA8Eus/s1600/MAN-droid.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-left: 7px;"><img border="0" height="150" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8O0Q89XOahI/TXYKd-s7kZI/AAAAAAAAAuQ/E3u6RgA8Eus/s200/MAN-droid.jpg" width="113" /></a></div><p>According to last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_are_so_many_android_owners_male.php">AdMod Mobile Metrics Report</a>, nearly three quarters of Android users are male. Sure, other tech gadgets and smartphone operating systems do tend to show a slight male bias, but why is the percentage of Android female users so dramatically low? And can anything be done to make Android more appealing to women?</p><br />These were the two key questions I tried to answer while searching for a topic to present at the recent <a href="http://mobilecamp.si/">MobileCamp Ljubljana</a>, Android edition. I was pretty sure more than three quarters of the audience at the event would be male (I was correct), so that seemed like a nice topic to explore with the guys, mostly app developers.<br /><br />You can see the slides from my talk embedded below. As the slides attracted quite some interest on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> (my first presentation that got featured on the homepage!), I also decided to do a little write-up on my blog, to expand on some of the key points.<br /><div id="__ss_7158585" style="width: 425px;"><strong style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/android-for-girls-a-new-frontier" title="Android for girls: a new frontier"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">Android for girls: a new frontier</span></a></strong> <object height="355" id="__sse7158585" width="425"> <param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=androidforgirlz-110305061532-phpapp02&stripped_title=android-for-girls-a-new-frontier&userName=ialja" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse7158585" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=androidforgirlz-110305061532-phpapp02&stripped_title=android-for-girls-a-new-frontier&userName=ialja" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed> </object> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">View more </span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">presentations</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"> from </span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">iAlja</span></a></div></div>So, why aren&#8217;t more girls using Android? What can we do to make Android phones feel right and not (only) a geek device?<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Who defines the user experience and perception of Android?</span></span></b><br /><br />Given the complexity of the Android ecosystem, we basically have three major groups of players that define the look and feel of Android:<br /><ul><li>On the basic level we have <b>Google defining core OS functionality and design</b>.</li><li>On the next level we have various <b>phone manufacturers</b> (HTC, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson etc.), who define the <b>hardware characteristics</b> of the devices and can also create <b>their own user interface modifications and software modifications</b>. Together with mobile operators, they&#8217;re also the ones that make sure end-users buy their Android devices through ads and promotions.</li><li>And finally, on top level, we have <b>application developers</b>, who create apps that <b>enhance the functionality of Android phones</b>.</li></ul><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Android as an operating system</span></span></b><br /><br />Without any doubt, Google has a &#8220;cool&#8221; status among geeks. We all love free Google services, and the geeks and hackers rejoiced at the announcement of Android, Google&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; alternative to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;evil&#8221; iPhone walled garden.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vfMPaEgdGtM/TXYLX80qqtI/AAAAAAAAAuU/obEsiQNzXig/s1600/android-system-architecture.jpg" /></a></div><br />In some aspects, Android is trying hard to imitate iOS (the operating system running on iPhones), but on the other hand, it does provide users, manufacturers and developers a bit more freedom when it comes to customizing your device. Ask any true Android geek, and they&#8217;ll tell you how awesome their Android phone is if you just install the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5596108/how-to-choose-the-right-android-rom-for-you">right ROM</a> (a modified version of the OS).<br /><br />Wait, what? Yeah, it does sound a lot like listening to Linux fans. And we all know that your typical Linux users is certainly not female. Well, the same problem seems to apply to Android. Perhaps the manufacturers, with their unique user interfaces, can make Android look prettier to girls?<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Android as a product</span></b></span><br /><br />Well, sort of. To be fair, some manufacturers are really trying to make Android easier to use for us, common people, and not just the geeks, who have the unstoppable urge to hack everything with a chip.<br /><br />For instance, HTC is really trying hard to make Android devices friendly little helpers through <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/htcsense/index.html">HTC Sense</a>. It can do some pretty nifty tricks like ringing louder when it&#8217;s tucked in our bags or displaying friends&#8217; latest Facebook status update when they call, so you can instantly tell it&#8217;s their birthday.<br /><br />But then, you get ads for Android devices like the following one for Motorola&#8217;s Droid. Let&#8217;s watch it together:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/w83UQkiuNZQ" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Oh yeah! 30 seconds of pure, raw manpower. Did you get the chance to grab a beer?<br /><br />Ok, to be fair, it&#8217;s not a new ad, and some of Motorola&#8217;s recent ads are a bit more neutral. But the ad above is an extreme case of a trend we often see when manufacturers and mobile operators promote their Android devices: too much emphasis on technical specifications and forgetting the human touch.<br /><br />Motorola&#8217;s Xoom Super Bowl ad was a bit better at making their Android device look more human friendly, but their final tagline still reads <i>&#8220;The world first Android 3.0 tablet&#8221;</i>. Yawn!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8BPFODsob1I" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Now, dear Motorola (and others), do watch how you make ads that focus on the experience and human emotion:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6CRfHl1Glwk" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />But of course, to make ads like this, you also need products that focus on the end-user, who is not necessarily a geek or a hacker.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Android and apps - the Market(ing) problem</span></span></b><br /><br />So finally, we reach the apps, the final piece of any modern smartphone puzzle that can make or break the user experience. Here is when I came across some interesting research; <a href="http://wallblog.co.uk/2010/07/07/women-twice-as-likely-as-men-to-never-have-downloaded-an-app/">according to The Wall Blog</a>, <b>women with smartphones (not such a minority anymore) are&nbsp;twice as likely as men to never have downloaded an app</b>. Hm, that&#8217;s a huge gap.<br /><br />When asked for reasons, some of the most common answers given by women were that the they felt overwhelmed by the choice of apps, and that apps were not relevant to them because they didn&#8217;t help them or enhanced their lives. So, we clearly have a marketing problem when it comes to selling apps, especially to women.<br /><br />My guess is that this problem is more pronounced in the Android Market, where, due to the lack of strict guidelines, it&#8217;s more difficult to find quality apps. Apple is trying to make app discovery easier by providing curated selections of apps.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kQWDNupkGUI/TXYL8Xk7XmI/AAAAAAAAAuc/NvFJ3ZwUEHw/s1600/apple-apps-for-parents.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kQWDNupkGUI/TXYL8Xk7XmI/AAAAAAAAAuc/NvFJ3ZwUEHw/s1600/apple-apps-for-parents.jpg" /></a></div><br />For a good example of this, visit the Apps for iPhone section on Apple&#8217;s website, where apps for different needs, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-everything/momsdads.html">Apps for Moms and Dads</a>,&nbsp;are clearly presented with big pictures and short descriptions. And you can be pretty sure that apps that make it to this page have been thoroughly tested and will probably make a good purchase.<br /><br />And that is what Android Market could really use. But who will be brave enough to attempt such a massive feat of strength? And how will users find such content, when most of them probably aren&#8217;t looking for specialized blogs and sites on the subject? Apple certainly has the advantage of being the one and only company to make their phone, market it and sell apps for it through their own App Store.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">What do women want from mobile apps?</span></span></b><br /><br />The big question for all app developers is, of course, what do women want from mobile apps? How can we make apps that women will want to download?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n77AvXbMv_U/TXYMZbJmPkI/AAAAAAAAAug/9UQ43dsNzCk/s1600/iStock_000005891287Medium+Woman+Bench.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n77AvXbMv_U/TXYMZbJmPkI/AAAAAAAAAug/9UQ43dsNzCk/s1600/iStock_000005891287Medium+Woman+Bench.jpg" /></a></div><br />I found a really good answer to this on the <a href="http://www.handshake20.com/2010/11/this-womans-gotta-have-mobile-apps-.html">Handshake 2.0 blog</a>, where&nbsp;Maureen Carruthers writes about what she&#8217;s looking for in mobile apps (emphasis mine):<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">&#8220;The ﬁnal quality of my favorite apps is </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">how they make me feel - about myself</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. &#8230; these apps help me feel </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">loved, well-read and prepared</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. &#8230; Most importantly, they are intuitive, so they <b>n</b></span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">ever make me feel stupid</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. No matter how potentially amazing an app may be, if I can’t easily ﬁgure it out, it will gather virtual dust.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></i></div><br />Another <a href="http://www.handshake20.com/Women_and_Mobile_Apps_Survey_Piedmont_Research_Associates.pdf">survey among female mobile app users</a> came to the conclusion that (emphasis mine):<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">“</span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Women want to </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">be connected</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. They want to </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">be informed</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. They want apps that </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">help them through the day</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">, whether it is comparison shopping, turn-by-turn directions, or a way to be more organized.”</span></i></div><br />So, we don&#8217;t want clutter, we don&#8217;t need extra bling - we want apps that are easy to use and that makes our lives better or easier! Women are probably more likely than men to see their phones as tools that shouldn&#8217;t require a manual, but should provide clear value in everyday life.<br /><br />Of course, this doesn&#8217;t apply to just women - many users outside the geeky, tech crowd feel the same! And here&#8217;s my advice for app developers: <b>focus on everyday usability and experience, not on fancy algorithms and tech talk</b>.<br /><br />Instagram, for instance, is a good examples of a great mobile app service that isn&#8217;t anything special from the technological point of view, but it does provide great experience and community. And that&#8217;s what counts for most users, not necessarily just women. (Excellent blog post on a related note:&nbsp;<a href="http://madebymany.com/blog/quora-is-from-mars-instagram-is-from-venus">Quora is from Mars, Instagram is from Venus</a>)<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">A girl&#8217;s app manifesto</span></span></b><br /><br />Finally, here are 7 key points I wish every app developer, male or female, would keep in mind when planning, designing or programming mobile apps.<br /><ol><li><b>Think about me.</b>&nbsp;</li><li>I don’t like wasting time.&nbsp;</li><li>Make my <b>life better</b> or fun.&nbsp;</li><li>Don’t make me feel stupid.&nbsp;</li><li>Don’t make me change for you.</li><li>I’m looking for <b>experiences</b>, not features.</li><li>Yes, I like <b>pretty</b>, but I’m not a princess.</li></ol><div>There are of course several resources anyone can find on the web that can help you better understand how women are using mobile apps. Some interesting sites I recently came across are:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.LadyGeekTV.com/">LadyGeekTV.com</a> and <a href="http://www.WomenWithDroids.com/">WomenWithDroids.com</a>.&nbsp;</div><br />And in the comments, I&#8217;d love to hear from more women using smartphones (Android or other) and particularly your experience with mobile apps. Android and mobile app development might still be a man&#8217;s world, but we can try to change things by speaking out about what we do and don&#8217;t like.<br /><br /><hr /><br />P.S.: Happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day">Women&#8217;s Day</a>!<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="25" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8IyKg6Dw1No" title="YouTube video player" width="200"></iframe><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/03/android-for-girls-new-frontier.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/03/android-for-girls-new-frontier.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--y7jXcdkklc/TXJ0R_rhiLI/AAAAAAAAAs4/VDF-SS_ZO_s/s1600/ipad-education.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="120" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--y7jXcdkklc/TXJ0R_rhiLI/AAAAAAAAAs4/VDF-SS_ZO_s/s200/ipad-education.jpg" width="150" /></a></div><p><a href="/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7-facts.html">In part 1</a>, I talked about my personal experience with three of the most popular operating systems for mobile devices of today and the future. In this post, I&#8217;d like to continue my analysis by looking at which OS has the biggest potential to become a hit product of our classrooms.</p><br />So, we have three main contenders running for classroom OS of the year:<br /><ul><li><b>iOS</b>, the app focused OS running on incredibly sexy Apple mobile devices,</li><li><b>Android</b>, the geeky OS of many choices and opportunities that can even be installed on an e-book reader and</li><li><b>Windows Phone 7</b>, Microsoft&#8217;s attempt to catch up by focusing on a simple user experience (and making Apple fans feel bad for liking a Windows device).</li></ul><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">What the school is looking for</span></span></b><br /><br />And we&#8217;re at Sunnydale High School. Helen, the principal, really wants to make their school cool and fun by providing their students and teachers with one-to-one technology. After all, it&#8217;s so hard to capture students&#8217; attention these days, and being proficient with computers will surely give students a competitive edge in the information society of the future.<br /><br />But here&#8217;s the thing: the school is on a really tight budget and they have to decide what to invest in. Should they install interactive blackboards in every classroom? Get a computer in every classroom? Give each student their own computer?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jnYoB9KgTy4/TXJ6RjVWPtI/AAAAAAAAAtY/x60voSiDGxw/s1600/thinking_person.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jnYoB9KgTy4/TXJ6RjVWPtI/AAAAAAAAAtY/x60voSiDGxw/s1600/thinking_person.jpg" /></a></div><br />That&#8217;s all very expensive, and the investment they made in those tiny netbooks two years ago didn&#8217;t really pay off. Nobody likes them. The teachers hate them because the screens are so tiny and because Word is so slow to use. The students hate them because they are slower than the computers they have at home and because even their phones provide a better Facebook experience. And the IT stuff hates them because they are just as annoying to maintain and support as their big brothers in the computer lab. So, the netbooks are mostly collecting dust in the closets. or being used as paperweight - at least something they&#8217;re sort of good at.<br /><br />Is the answer in those new mobile, post-PC devices everyone keeps talking about? Let&#8217;s take a look!<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The smartphones</span></span></b><br /><br />There is one big problem with using smartphones in classrooms: most students don&#8217;t have them (yet) and schools probably can&#8217;t afford to be buying phones for their students, as the prices are quite steep without a contract with a mobile operator.<br /><br />In a few years, when smartphones become common place, sure, they might become great learning aids in classroom, but until them we&#8217;ll probably see them used as personal learning tools by students with the privilege of owning one. Unless mobile operators start making deals with schools, of course, which is not probably not something we can put our money on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/index.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2rtNrLvfqgg/TXJ7gOAN0uI/AAAAAAAAAtc/gSVjHNSF5Nk/s1600/ultimate_thesaurus-web.jpg" /></a></div>And even when most students have smartphones, the biggest potential might not be in their operating systems and native apps, but in <b>web apps</b> that students on any mobile platform with a modern browser can use. Even Apple already has a nice webpage dedicated to touch ready <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/whatarewebapps.html">Web apps</a>. Truth be told, web apps are probably more convenient for schools than managing native mobile apps (especially paid ones). The only requirement for schools here is a reliable WiFi network that can handle hundreds of concurrent devices.<br /><br />Microsoft did however showcase an interesting glimpse into the future of connected devices with a Windows Phone 7 integration with Kinect, a system that allows Xbox users to control games with body movements. The video below looks like pure fun, but just imagine transferring this idea to a classroom full of students and enable them to interact with software with a combination of body movements and touch inputs on various mobile devices.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ehS-AfM4b8I" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br /><b><i>Verdict:</i></b><i> Smartphones are probably not a viable option for most classrooms yet. However, as smartphones with modern browsers become more commonplace, web apps might have the biggest potential because they are platform independent. Just make sure to have a good WiFi network in place to avoid expensive data charges. Another interesting opportunity will be brought by the ability of smartphones to connect to other devices and form a rich interaction network based on natural inputs.</i><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The smartphones minus the phone</span></span></b><br /><br />The next category of devices to look at is the smartphones without the ability to connect to cellphone networks i.e. mainly Apple&#8217;s <b><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iPod Touch</a></b>. It&#8217;s got most of the goodies of its big brother, the iPhone 4, but at less than half its price.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ipodtouch-iphone/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uMTq3IgqHhQ/TXJ4Wi0y2nI/AAAAAAAAAtM/_gIhqWNEhQM/s1600/ipod_touch-apps_edu.jpg" /></a></div>The drawback is that you have to rely on WiFi networks for internet connectivity. Luckily, these are getting increasingly popular at more and more places, and practically all schools I&#8217;ve visited recently have at least some sort of WiFi network of their own.<br /><br />And the iPod Touch also brings an important advantage to the table: there are already several documented studies of successful uses of iPod Touches (and even the less capable devices in the iPod family) in classrooms. And Apple even provides a special <a href="http://images.apple.com/education/docs/Apple-iPodGettingStartedGuide081809.pdf">PDF&nbsp;guide for using iPod touch and iTunes for teaching and learning</a>.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YPchHSt5tPQ/TXJ406w6mkI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/54MLlmaeVtY/s1600/ipod_touch-itunesU.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YPchHSt5tPQ/TXJ406w6mkI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/54MLlmaeVtY/s1600/ipod_touch-itunesU.jpg" /></a></div>We&#8217;re probably all aware of the fact that podcasting has been in use for several years in education now, and that&#8217;s all the iPod Touch does extremely well. But it&#8217;s biggest strength are of course the apps. A lot of <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ipodtouch-iphone/">quality apps that can be used in classroom</a>.<br /><br />And while the school still needs to figure out ways to manage different iPod Touches and keep them all charged and synced, the updating process certainly is less of a hassle than on regular computer. There are <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1495">several ways</a> to use the same computer with different devices or have multiple devices linked to one iTunes account, a <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/education/">special program</a> for buying and distributing apps to students in volume, and even custom mobile labs (more on that later). However, having to sync Apple&#8217;s devices with iTunes is probably the biggest hassle iOS devices have, so that&#8217;s probably something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Ok, moving on to competitors. Hmmm. Ah, there is one - Samsung&#8217;s <b><a href="http://www.gadgetsandgizmos.org/samsung-galaxy-player-50-review/">Galaxy Player</a></b>, the first Android powered competitor to the iPod Touch. But here&#8217;s the thing - it&#8217;s not on the market yet. It will supposedly be a bit cheaper than the iPod Touch - both in price and hardware. So, let&#8217;s just wait to see this one on the market first and see how it does, ok?<br /><br />Right. So, we have Windows Phone 7 left. Sadly, as the name indicates, it&#8217;s a phone OS, so no real competition here either. On the other hand, we could include <b><a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/products/zunehd/default.htm">Zune HD</a></b>, Microsoft&#8217;s portable media player, in the mix, considering the experience is somehow similar to WP7.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_zWi67YPDNo/TXJ5aO-X3kI/AAAAAAAAAtU/oqHc1xUSkIs/s1600/zuneHD.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_zWi67YPDNo/TXJ5aO-X3kI/AAAAAAAAAtU/oqHc1xUSkIs/s1600/zuneHD.jpg" /></a></div>So, what does the Zune HD has to offer? Yes, music and video of course. What about apps? Aye, it has apps! How many? 42. And how many apps are there for the iPod Touch? About 350,000. Right, I rest my case.<br /><br /><b><i>Verdict:</i></b><i> The iPod Touch certainly is a big winner here with a proven track record of classroom excellence. It&#8217;s a great device for podcasting, and on top of that supports tons of quality educational apps. It will be very hard for competitors to catch up with this little gem anytime soon!</i><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The tablets</span></span></b><br /><br />Let&#8217;s just move to the next category of mobile device that will supposedly be a bit more crowded this year: the tablets. <br /><br />This week Apple announced the <b><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad 2</a></b>. Now thinner, faster, lighter, with cameras, 10-hour battery life, even more magic and the same starting price - $499. It&#8217;s the original iPad made better and there are over 65,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OrnOm-kUMp8/TXJ1CCZiP3I/AAAAAAAAAs8/qbLafMHHrDE/s1600/iPad-apps.jpg" /></a></div><br />The original iPad is already being used to enhance teaching and learning on all levels. For some inspiring examples, have a look at the short promo video on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ipad/">Learning with iPad</a> site.&nbsp;And for schools, Apple is even offering incredibly sleek iPad Learning Labs (I want a cabinet filled with iPads too!), so it&#8217;s definitely a big plus to have various <a href="http://images.apple.com/education/docs/Apple-iOS-Learning-Solutions_20110218.pdf">iOS Learning Solutions</a> readily available.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/education/labs/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FdO-nCOVebI/TXJyD96zt0I/AAAAAAAAAs0/HPNAN2mCXwQ/s1600/ipad_labs_20110218.jpg" /></a></div>15 million&nbsp;iPads were sold all over the world in just 9 months, so there&#8217;s no doubt the new model will also be a hit. Probably the biggest challenge that Apple is facing with the iPad is how to ship enough units to satisfy the huge demand for this truly magical device - and that&#8217;s certainly a good problem to be having!<br /><br />Now, moving on to Android. The recent Mobile World Congress was full of new Android tablet announcements. The powerful Motorola Xoom, already on sale in the States, Samsung offering a new, iPad size 10 inch version of its Galaxy Tab, LG G-Slate, Acer Iconia Tabs, Asus Eee Pads, Dell Streak 10&#8230; They come in all shapes and sizes, varying from 7 to 10 inches. One thing they all have in common: <b>Android 3.0 Honeycomb</b>. The first version of Android designed specifically for tablets.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/XOOM/index.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n4zcCXxtD6g/TXJ1X2KH_ZI/AAAAAAAAAtA/Y63WKen8Q-g/s1600/motorola_xoom.jpg" /></a></div>My first impression from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPUGNCIozp0">videos</a> and reviews? It looks&#8230; crowded. Yes, some elements are rather nice - the way it does multitasking, notifications. But it seems like it&#8217;s trying to borrow a bit too much from the desktop world. I especially wonder how that will work out on the smaller tablets. I haven&#8217;t had the chance to try out a Honeycomb device yet, as they are only starting to ship, so my opinion might change once I actually get to try a Honeycomb device first hand.<br /><br />But there is one big elephant in the Honeycomb room: the lack of apps for Android tablets. Sure, Honeycomb does a good job at scaling up apps made for Android smarphones of smaller sizes, but having apps designed for tablets in mind is a different story. Think <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-a-visual-exploration/id364147847?mt=8#">The Elements app</a> for the iPad.<br /><br />And here, yet again, <b>Apple has a massive head start</b>. Sure, in a year or two the number of Honeycomb apps will probably be more respectable, but for now, sitting around 100, the lack of apps remains it&#8217;s Achilles&#8217; heel.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/imovie.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Vfj-tyM36mo/TXJ1_TiG5rI/AAAAAAAAAtE/A8W1MMAAc7I/s1600/ipad-imovie.jpg" /></a></div>In the meantime, the iPad is getting new, amazing new apps every day. Like the mind blowing iPad versions of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/imovie.html">iMovie</a>&nbsp;(shown above) and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/garageband.html">Garage Band</a>&nbsp;made by Apple. I can&#8217;t imagine those two running on an Android tablet, but I surely can see those two apps being used by students all all ages in classrooms all over the world!<br /><br />So, the impression I get here is that the manufacturers will have to invest a lot of effort in making their Android tablets more user friendly. HTC, for instance, has showcased a pretty nifty notetaking app that works with Evernote on its 7 inch <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/flyer/overview.html">HTC Flyer</a> tablet (also just announced at the Mobile World Congress, not yet on the market). Not sure about the additional stylus, but it looks pretty interesting!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/X8R11CNm9kI" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Another interesting fact is that the HTC Flyer won&#8217;t ship with Honeycomb, but rather with Android 2.3 Gingerbread with a special edition of HTC Sense (HTC&#8217;s custom UI modification for Android) made just for tablets. HTC says a Honeycomb update is being worked on, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t help with the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20023199-264.html">Android fragmentation issues</a>.<br /><br />Now, the great thing about Android is its tight integration with Google services. And that could be a good selling point for Android tablets in education, as a lot of students already have Google Accounts, and a lot of schools might even be using Google Apps for Education already. Very convenient!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/edu/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DbRrfIFx4j8/TXJ29WukIcI/AAAAAAAAAtI/-ROAvsI_Va4/s1600/firstdayofschool09-hp.gif" /></a></div>It would be even more convenient if Google you could get Google Apps for Education in a big package with Android tablets, but unfortunately that is very unlikely considering that Google isn&#8217;t a hardware company. Which means that schools looking to buy Android tablets will have to do it on their own or get help from some other company (anyone aware of companies providing Google Apps and Android tablets bundles?).<br /><br />But let&#8217;s not forget <a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/">App Inventor</a>, Google&#8217;s free and relatively easy to use tool for programming Android apps that is targeted at the educational market. Now, THAT looks interesting, but it&#8217;s surely not for every school at every level. It&#8217;s more of a niche candy that will hopefully attract students to Android development, which might someday result in better Android apps.<br /><br />So, Android does have some advantages, but at the same time the tablets are having a hard time matching iPad&#8217;s $499 starting price. For instance, the Motorola Xoom&#8217;s $800 (no contract) entry price is anything but compatible. Yes, it does Google services well, but there are still tons of other apps that are still missing.<br /><br />What about Windows Phone 7? Again, notice the phone in the name? Microsoft apparently wants your to have the WP7 experience on your smartphone only. And the <b>Windows tablets</b> will be running, well, Windows 7. Windows tablets have been on the market way before the iPad with little success. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oEPX9PN8uUA/TXJ-3Dy6z4I/AAAAAAAAAto/IBlM4UcxNQM/s1600/Pioneer-windows-7-tablet-pc_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oEPX9PN8uUA/TXJ-3Dy6z4I/AAAAAAAAAto/IBlM4UcxNQM/s1600/Pioneer-windows-7-tablet-pc_.jpg" /></a></div><br />Sure, it&#8217;s a familiar environment for users, but so far it seems that users prefer a much more simpler OS on their portable devices, so I&#8217;m not really placing any bets on Windows 7 (or 8) tablets. Steve Jobs had this to say about tablets:&nbsp;“<a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/04/steve-jobs-post-pc-credo/">These are post-PC devices, that need to be even easier to use than a PC.</a>” Agreed.<br /><br /><b><i>Verdict:</i></b><i> It seems that 2011 will yet again be the year of the iPad. Yes, Android tablets have great integration with Google services most of already use, and the App Inventor is an interesting tool for learning and teaching programming, but the steep prices and the lack of apps are a major disappointment. Plus, most of the new Android tablets that have been announced are not on the market yet, so we&#8217;ll probably have to wait at least another year for a real Android tablet breakthrough. As to Microsoft, they&#8217;d better start thinking about how to make the tablet experience as pleasant as their new smartphone experience. Again, at least a year or more before that happens. In the mean time, the iPad might become just as iconic and commonplace as the iPods on the market for MP3 players.</i><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Which devices are classroom ready? Today?</span></span></b><br /><br />I think I&#8217;ve made it pretty clear that the market for smart mobile devices is far from mature. Apple is leading the way in practically every category and others are playing catch up. Sure, Android is rapidly gaining market share when it comes to smartphones (not surprisingly, considering the number and variety of devices), but the tablet market (much more interesting for education) is still in its infancy. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s1neteskxXQ/TXJ8Q3-0CxI/AAAAAAAAAtg/0qmkG73WkAA/s1600/iphone-ipad.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s1neteskxXQ/TXJ8Q3-0CxI/AAAAAAAAAtg/0qmkG73WkAA/s1600/iphone-ipad.png" /></a></div>Apple&#8217;s iOS devices - mainly the iPod Touch and the iPad - do however have one huge advantage: the <b>choice of quality apps and the affordable price</b>. Additionally, schools can even get convenient mobile learning labs with iOS devices, so they&#8217;re easier to manage.&nbsp;And that&#8217;s why I think that today the iPod Touch and the iPad are the best choice for classrooms - and for encouraging learning outside of classrooms as well.<br /><br />The Android tablets have been rather disappointing&nbsp;so far, though the situation might change when more Honeycomb tablets (and apps) become available on the market. But without apps that can compare to those already available for the iPad, the competition will be a rather boring one.<br /><br />So, for today, my vote certainly goes to the iPod Touch and the iPad (depending on your budget). I know I might sound like an Apple commercial, but these two devices are truly amazing to use, and the competition is still lagging behind. So, for now, I really can&#8217;t wait to get the new iPad and have tons of fun exploring all the new apps and learning new stuff along the way. What about your classroom?<br /><br /><a href="/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7-facts.html">&gt;&gt; iOS, Android and Windows Phone 7: the facts and my experience [Part 1]</a><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

And that&#8217;s not even taking into account tables and iPods that provide similar functionality. In short, mobile devices - or &#8220;post-PC devices&#8221;, as Steve Jobs calls them - are hot stuff right now.</p><br />However, it&#8217;s easy to get lost and confused by all the devices and even by all the mobile operating systems we can choose from. Apple is certainly leading this new revolution with the iPhone and the iPad, but other software and hardware companies are trying their best to catch up and capture our imagination.<br /><br />Last Summer I started blogging at <a href="http://tehnik.mobitel.si/">Mobitel Tehnik</a>, a blog about mobile technologies, on which&nbsp;<a href="http://tehnik.mobitel.si/author/alja-sulcic/">my posts</a> (in Slovenian) mainly cover news and tips related to&nbsp;mobile app&nbsp;development. As part of my assignment, I&#8217;ve been using and following the development of some of the recently most popular smart mobile operating systems on the market.<br /><br />That is why I&#8217;ve decided to sum up some of the thoughts and experiences I&#8217;ve had with various platforms on my blog in two parts: in the first part, I focus on introducing facts and my personal experience with 3 of the most talked about smartphone operating systems: Apple&#8217;s <b>iOS</b>, Google&#8217;s <b>Android</b>, and Microsoft&#8217;s <b>Windows Phone 7</b>. And in <a href="/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7.html">part 2</a>, I will try to imagine the potential of using iOS, Android and WP7 mobile devices in classrooms.<br /><br />Ok, so let&#8217;s take a look at the facts and my personal experience with each of the three platforms first.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">iOS: It&#8217;s all about beautiful apps</span></span></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7yUn7gc8Bj8/TXDHNj9d8uI/AAAAAAAAAsg/_Lbz5ivgyog/s1600/ios-banner.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7yUn7gc8Bj8/TXDHNj9d8uI/AAAAAAAAAsg/_Lbz5ivgyog/s1600/ios-banner.jpg" /></a></div><br /><b><i>Basic facts</i></b><i>: Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system that runs on iPhones, iPod Touches, iPad and Apple TV - all Apple devices. Launched in June 2007, current version 4.2. Got its application store, the App Store (tied with the iTunes Store), in July 2008 and now features over 350,000 apps.</i><br /><br /><b>The experience:</b> Unfortunately, iPhone isn&#8217;t officially sold in my country (the only blank spot in Europe!), so I&#8217;ve been using iOS on my 2nd generation iPod Touch. Truth be told, I don&#8217;t really use it as an iPod that much - my primary iPod used mainly for running is the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod Nano</a>. The iPod Touch is, however, my mobile device of choice for browsing and apps. I use it to play various casual games like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bejeweled-2-blitz/id284832142?mt=8">Bejeweled Blitz</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fruit-ninja/id362949845?mt=8">Fruit Ninja</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-wings/id417817520?mt=8">Tiny Wings</a> (my current favorites), manage my shopping list with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shopshop-shopping-list/id288350249?mt=8">ShopShop</a>, plan my runs with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/runners-world-smartcoach/id377197137?mt=8">Runner&#8217;s World SmartCoach</a> app, rate my favorite <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/movies-by-flixster-rotten/id284235722?mt=8">Movies</a>, and much more. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aXdBYvoQG-s/TXDIa7EIt5I/AAAAAAAAAsk/ShU3da3CEmQ/s1600/app_store-billion_apps.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aXdBYvoQG-s/TXDIa7EIt5I/AAAAAAAAAsk/ShU3da3CEmQ/s1600/app_store-billion_apps.png" /></a></div><br />And I&#8217;m just in love with iOS apps! The <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/">App Store</a> provides great choice of both free and paid apps, and it&#8217;s really easy to discover beautiful new apps. It&#8217;s the kind of store where you buy <a href="http://outsideapp.com/">a $2.99 weather app</a> just because it&#8217;s sooo pretty.<br /><br />The magic behind the App Store lies in detailed guidelines and excellent developer tools that make it easy to have good looking apps even if you use just the default UI elements provided by Apple. Yes, a lot of people complain about the strict App Store approval process, but from the user perspective, it pays off to have a store full of quality and well tested apps.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Android: It&#8217;s all about opportunities and promises</span></span></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W-_w3nmXMFE/TXDG6wxfoBI/AAAAAAAAAsc/RY8ImzXNwcg/s1600/androids.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="277" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W-_w3nmXMFE/TXDG6wxfoBI/AAAAAAAAAsc/RY8ImzXNwcg/s400/androids.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><b><br /></b><br /><b><i>Basic facts:</i></b><i> Usually thought as the biggest iOS competitor, developed by Google and other members of the Open Handset Alliance. Launched in October 2008, current version 2.3 Gingerbread, although the majority of users currently still runs version 2.2 Froyo. Android runs on all sorts of smartphone and tablets devices in various price ranges. The devices are made by different manufacturers, which also provide their unique user interfaces (such as HTC Sense, Samsung&#8217;s TouchWiz etc). The Android application store, Android Market, launched in October 2008 and now features over 250,000 apps.</i><br /><br /><b>The experience:</b> Ah, dear <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>. The joy and love of the tech crowd. The supposedly &#8220;open alternative&#8221; to Apple&#8217;s evil walled-garden. And, more often than not, quite irritating to use.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve used Android on several <a href="http://www.htc.com/">HTC</a> devices (Desire, Legend, Wildfire) and the overall look and feel is quite good. The hardware was good, but what annoyed me to no end, was the need to constantly fiddle with settings and other details of the software. And the regular need to reboot, which reminded me of what it was like to own a PC.<br /><br />All in all, it was usually nothing huge per se, but there was always that tiny little detail that required your attention and sometimes got your head scratching. Like the mystery of why apps that I had never used (e.g. Stocks, Music, News) were always running in the background.<br /><br />Speaking of apps. Sure, in theory it does sound wonderful that Google lets almost anyone publish apps on the <a href="https://market.android.com/">Android Market</a>. But in practice? The Market is flooded with poorly designed apps. And as Android Market works with Google Checkout, which is not supported in my country, I was stuck on using free apps only.<br /><br />Then, the games&#8230; just not comparable to iOS games. And sure, the gaming aspect is supposed to be improved with the next big release - and that is basically what we keep hearing all the time. &#8220;The next Android update will kick iPhone&#8217;s ass!&#8221; Anyone else got tired of waiting for the savior?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TAh4yiCzgKw" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Ok, I&#8217;ve got to be fair - Android does have a few strong points as well. I loved the integration with Google services, particularly Google Maps. And the WiFi Hotspot app (for tethering), introduced with the Froyo update, was awesome. And oh, I really liked HTC&#8217;s weather widget on the home screen!<br /><br />Wondering why I&#8217;ve been using the past tense here? Ah, that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been using Windows Phone 7 as my primary phone OS for a couple of weeks now, and I honestly don&#8217;t miss Android all that much.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Windows Phone 7: It&#8217;s all about the simple experience</span></span></b><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HH3TjphatRI/TS7qHIk45oI/AAAAAAAAAqU/_uhvjfHyXvA/s1600/WP7-tiles.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HH3TjphatRI/TS7qHIk45oI/AAAAAAAAAqU/_uhvjfHyXvA/s1600/WP7-tiles.jpg" /></a></div><b><br /></b><br /><b><i>Basic facts:</i></b><i> The new kid on the block, even though it&#8217;s the successor of the ye olde Windows Mobile platform. Microsoft decided to get a fresh start with Windows Phone 7 and introduced a radically different user interface and no backwards compatibility with previous versions of Windows Mobile. WP7 launched in October 2010 and has yet to receive a major update (expected to be released soon-ish). Like Android, WP7 runs on devices by different manufacturers, but Microsoft sets the hardware requirements for WP7 phones and doesn&#8217;t allow major modifications of the user interface, so all WP7 phones have a consistent look and feel (unlike Android phones). Its applications store, the Windows Phone Marketplace, launched with the release of the first phones in October 2010 and now features over 8,000 apps.</i><br /><br /><b>The experience:</b> This may come as a surprise to those of you that know how much I love using a Mac - I actually enjoy the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/">Windows Phone 7</a> experience. Yes, me, enjoying a Windows product! Shocking, I know.<br /><br />But I think Microsoft did the smart thing by dropping the outdated Windows Mobile legacy platform and focused on a fresh, unique mobile experience. It&#8217;s a mobile OS that tries to help users do what they&#8217;re supposed to be doing without getting in the way. <br /><br />Coming from Android, the contrast can be quite stark at first. But after a while, you just sit back and enjoy the ride. No need to worry about turning the GPS on and off manually. If an app, such as Maps, needs it, it will turn it on and then off again when you&#8217;re done. <br /><br />The home screen with live tiles makes it easy to see important information on the go, and the OS uses hubs to bundle key content and media together. For instance, the People hub brings together your contacts and their Facebook updates in an attractive panorama view. Plus, it can also sync music, photos and videos with your computer and there&#8217;s even a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/windows-phone-7-connector/id415571499?mt=12">Windows Phone 7 Connector</a> for Mac OS X that can sync content from iTunes.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pdx4BOqy_KU" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />However, it must be noted that WP7 is still a version 1.0 OS, so there are &#8220;a few&#8221; bugs and oddities that will have to be sorted out. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/apps/default.aspx">Marketplace</a> is still only a few months old, so the selection of apps isn&#8217;t that great. For instance, there is no Dropbox or Evernote app, and I miss more apps from Google, particularly Google Maps - WP7, not surprisingly, has Bing Maps integrated and the app just doesn&#8217;t work as well as Google&#8217;s. <br /><br />And just like the Android Market, the Windows Phone Marketplace doesn&#8217;t allow purchases from my country, so I can&#8217;t really enjoy any of the cool game titles already available in the application store. You do however get the option to Try out a lot of the paid apps and games, which is a really cool feature.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">And the winner is&#8230;</span></span></b><br /><br />One thing is for sure - while similar on paper, iOS, Android and Windows Phone 7 provide quite a different user experience. Which one is best? Well, it really depends on what you&#8217;re looking for.<br /><br />iOS is certainly a more solid platform with an amazing selection of apps, which isn&#8217;t surprising considering it was the first to launch. Android is perfect for geeks that enjoy fiddling with their devices. And WP7 is cute, but needs to grow up a bit more and get more developers interested in making good apps. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P7d7H8Wne70/TXDNW4PsVEI/AAAAAAAAAso/bYhPGquR8xQ/s1600/ipod-touch.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-P7d7H8Wne70/TXDNW4PsVEI/AAAAAAAAAso/bYhPGquR8xQ/s1600/ipod-touch.jpg" /></a></div><br />For me, iOS is certainly the first choice. It&#8217;s simple, yet mature enough to provide all the extra goodies (such as tethering). WP7 is also an OS that I could see my grandpa using, as he probably wouldn&#8217;t miss any of the yet missing apps. And Android is a solid choice for everyone that is bothered by Apple&#8217;s &#8220;closed&#8221; system and is looking for variety in hardware, but not something I&#8217;d recommend for the average user.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">What does it all mean?</span></span></b><br /><br />So, we have at least three platforms that will be running smartphones and tablets of our future. And we keep hearing the future will be mobile, which also means we can expect the big mobile operating systems to find their way into our classrooms and be used as teaching tools. I therefore invite you to join me in <a href="/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7.html">part 2</a> to explore which of the 3 platforms might have the biggest potential for learning.<br /><br /><a href="/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7.html">&gt;&gt;&nbsp;iOS, Android and Windows Phone 7: the classroom potential [Part 2]</a><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7-facts.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7-facts.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

This year, I&#8217;m particularly excited about attending <b><a href="http://2011.imoot.org/">iMoot2011</a></b>, the second annual web based International Moodle Moot.</p>iMoot2011 will be running from <b>30th April to 3rd May 2011</b>, 24 hours a day to accommodate different time zones. If you want to get involved as a presenter, you can <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=4">submit presentation proposals and academic papers</a>&nbsp;by February 19th, or&nbsp;<a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=9">register</a>&nbsp;as an attendee (got my early bird registration yesterday!).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=11" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="156" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TUfWyoZRhwI/AAAAAAAAAq4/aab6wPjlNIk/s320/new_directions.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />The theme for iMoot2011 is <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/mod/book/view.php?id=31&amp;chapterid=11"><b>New Directions</b></a>, a fitting title considering Moodle 2.0 has finally been released at the end of last year. However, it&#8217;s good to know that Moodle&#8217;s new directions won&#8217;t be the main focus on the conference; instead, the goal of the conference will be to explore the potential of using new technologies and pedagogical ideas in an evolving online learning space, where Moodle is just a piece of the puzzle.<br /><br />You can find more info about the conference on the <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/">official iMoot2011 website</a>. I&#8217;m certainly looking forward to participating in the conference, getting new ideas and meeting new and old Moolde buddies.

Davis reminds us about how important it is to give genuine compliments to our students and colleagues every day. I certainly try to follow this advice in my day to day work. Remembering to thank people for their effort and acknowledging their success is a simple gesture that can make a big impact. After all, we all want to be good at what we&#8217;re doing and to know that what we do is meaningful, don&#8217;t we?<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Challenge: Do Nothing for Two Minutes</span></b><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TT2CuUTc9JI/AAAAAAAAAqs/XKTRdWJDWRI/s1600/do-nothing-for-2-minutes.png" /></a></div><br /><b>Why it&#8217;s worth sharing:</b>&nbsp;It&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/">simple website</a> with a simple idea: relax and do nothing for only two minutes. Easy, no? Well, it turns out it can be quite a challenge if you&#8217;re used to constantly check your e-mails, Facebook, Twitter and what not. It&#8217;s certainly a nice idea that encourages to stop and relax, even if it is just for our couple of minutes. Perhaps we&#8217;d all felt a little bit better if we passed this simple challenge every day.

<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/h#" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7xfggYv1I/AAAAAAAAAqY/vgXUarsDnAM/s1600/appstore_20100403.jpg" /></a><br />The web seems like somethings everyone should know how to use by now. But what about the less experienced aka the majority of users? Do they really know how to use their browsers? And understand what&#8217;s going on on their computer screens?<br /><p>I think computers are still mysterious, magic boxes for a lot of people outside the tech savvy crowd, and we need to keep looking for solutions that can change that perception. Perhaps by learning from simple, easy to use, user centered mobile devices, like the iPad.</p><br /><b>The web is a strange place for the average user</b><br /><br />As a reader (or occasional visitor) of this blog, you probably have a good basic understanding of how the web works. You&#8217;re probably familiar with the concept of a web browser and how your browser interacts with web servers to display different web locations. You know how to copy, type and check the URL of a website to make sure you&#8217;ve opened the right web page, and you&#8217;re probably reading this page in one of the many tabs open in your browser, perhaps even an RSS reader.<br /><br />But all of the above isn&#8217;t such an easy task for everyone.&nbsp;If you think the web is easy to use, I challenge you to observe the way so-called &#8220;average users&#8221; interact with it. Users, who have never received any real training, and are not really interested in understanding how the whole system works. They just want to check their e-mail, share photos on Facebook or find a store&#8217;s phone number on the web.<br /><br />I have seem that many times in the past few months (while trying to teach them how to use a pretty complex online tool), and I must say it has changes my perspective. The web just seems like a different place for the average user than it is to me or probably you.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a place where the Google search box is your starting point because you don&#8217;t know the URL of your school&#8217;s website, it&#8217;s a place where you only use one window at a time (tabs? what tabs?), it&#8217;s a place full of confusion and notifications you don&#8217;t really understand. Update? Pop-ups? RSS? Java script? Is that even English?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2008/03/03/funny-pictures-we-dint-touch-it/"><img alt="Humorous Pictures" src="http://icanhascheezburger.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/funny-pictures-cats-computer-blue-screen-death.jpg" style="font-size: 552267px; word-spacing: 552267px;" /></a></div><br />It&#8217;s just so different from the world we, the tech crowd, live in. It&#8217;s not a world where the lack of multitasking before iOS 4 was a problem, it&#8217;s a world where no multitasking is a great feature.<br /><br /><b>Why do you make me switch windows and apps?</b><br /><br />It&#8217;s certainly something that we should all keep in mind when designing user interfaces and user experiences on the web. You think your registration process, which requires e-mail confirmation, is simple? Think again. The average user doesn&#8217;t want to switch windows and apps, and doesn&#8217;t want to read your friendly instructions about activation and other nonsense. They just want to get things done.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7qHIk45oI/AAAAAAAAAqU/vHMNkHVoYso/s1600/WP7-tiles.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7qHIk45oI/AAAAAAAAAqU/vHMNkHVoYso/s1600/WP7-tiles.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Photo: </i></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-ww/default.aspx"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Microsoft.com</i></span></a></td></tr></tbody></table>And that is where we can learn a lot from the new generation of smartphone operating systems (thinking mainly about iOS and Windows Phone 7, I&#8217;ll leave my Android rant for another post). They make it easier for people to understand what they&#8217;ll get and where to get it. With big, easy to tap icons, and a simple, physical Home button that always gets you back to the starting line. No complicated lists of programs, no need to decide where to save your files&#8230; In many ways, the mobile OS is smarter than your desktop OS, even though the &#8220;smartness&#8221; is a result of the limits such small devices have.<br /><br /><b>Let the OS do the work and just enjoy the ride</b><br /><br />Many of the features that make current smartphones so pleasant to use, were first introduced by Apple. Of course, a lot of skeptics laughed at the lack of multitasking, physical keyboard and what not, but 4 years after the original iPhone came out, everyone is trying to make a better iPhone. Not a better smartphone per se, but a better iPhone. And even though the geeks love Android for being a more open platform, iPhone keeps setting the standard for the high-end smartphone market.<br /><br />And I think Apple is actually on the right track again with the concept of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/">Mac OS X Lion</a>, the next major upgrade to their desktop OS due to be released this summer. Lion will take a bold step at bringing features from the mobile world - the magic of iPad, as they call it - to the desktop. A unified place to download, buy and update your applications, a launchpad with big, colorful icons, and full-screen apps that take away all the distractions of your desktop.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7ncrBNCuI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/r6auLqSJrGU/s1600/lion-full-screen-iphoto-app.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/TS7ncrBNCuI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/r6auLqSJrGU/s1600/lion-full-screen-iphoto-app.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Photo: </i></span><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Apple.com</i></span></a></td></tr></tbody></table>I can see all this being a big hit with the average users (time to switch grandpa to Mac OS X!). An app for Facebook, an app for your e-mail, an app for your workspace (which lives in the cloud, but you don&#8217;t really know or care about it), and an app for Google, so you can find everything else. And you don&#8217;t have to worry about whether apps are closed or open and about saving your work. You want to do something else? Fine, hit the &#8220;Home button&#8221; and come back to the first app when you&#8217;re done, picking it up just where you left it.<br /><br /><b>Mobile devices are changing our expectations</b><br /><br />While the emphasis in the discussions about the mobile revolution often seems to be on portability and the business opportunities of mobile apps, let&#8217;s not forget about how all these mobile devices are changing the way people interact with computers and their expectations. <br /><br />We are already seeing examples of how the iPad and similar devices are influencing web design, and I definitely think that&#8217;s a positive trend that will make more and more web destinations feel more natural and uncluttered. Now is the right time to take a look at the web sites we build and maintain, and figure out how to make it more mobile and consequently human friendly.<br /><br />And the end result will not be something just the less tech savvy users will enjoy; I think we can all benefit from less clutter and distractions. After all, it makes much more sense to have interfaces that adapt to the way people think, than to have people adapt to interfaces they have to use.<br /><br />Additional readings:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.inspiredm.com/2010/02/09/ipad-design/">How iPad Affects the Way we Design Websites? | Inspired Magazine</a></li><li><a href="http://memeburn.com/2011/01/4-ways-tablet-computing-is-influencing-web-design/">4 ways tablet computing is influencing web design | memeburn</a></li><li><a href="http://mashable.com/2010/09/30/ipad-web-design/">How the iPad Is Transforming Web Design (case studies) | Mashable</a></li><li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzgleuEUz0o">Apple Previews Mac OS X Lion | YouTube @BNETvideo</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/01/mobile-single-tasking-leads-way-to-more.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/01/mobile-single-tasking-leads-way-to-more.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
