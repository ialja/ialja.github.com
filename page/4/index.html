<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The mission: find a new home for my online hub</span></b><br /><br />Not long after Steve Jobs announced <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>, a free service that would replace (and, quite honestly, dramatically enhance) the existing paid <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/transition.html">MobileMe service</a>, it was clear that those of us that were using MobileMe to host our iWeb website <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/12/rumor-steve-jobs-iweb-mobileme/">would have to look for a new home</a>.<br /><br />Which, for me, meant looking for alternatives for hosting my online hub @ <a href="http://ialja.com/">iAlja.com</a>. Until recently, my online hub was a simple iWeb website that pointed to all my profiles around the web that I&#8217;m using actively, and had a few extra pages for an extended bio and featured work. Nothing complicated, and I liked it that way.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sadooByLa-I/TiWeAwIHOfI/AAAAAAAAAHE/zjnM64SEamo/s1600/ialja-iweb-website.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sadooByLa-I/TiWeAwIHOfI/AAAAAAAAAHE/zjnM64SEamo/s400/ialja-iweb-website.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Goodbye, old iWeb website!</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>But apparently time had come to find a new home for my online hub; a journey, which ended up on Tumblr. So, read on if you want to know why I chose Tumblr and how I&#8217;m using this micro-blogging platform as my personal website.</p><a name='more'></a><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Comparing alternatives for a personal online hub&nbsp;</span></b><br /><br />I started my journey with relatively simple requirements. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of content, so I didn&#8217;t need a complex CMS behind the website. I could have just transferred the website to different host, but I also wanted a simple way to edit the content whenever it was needed, without having to deal with HTML files and FTP upload.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-20_Tj4TomY8/TiXMvVsR1BI/AAAAAAAAAHU/oxM5W1Z0zSQ/s1600/website-alternatives.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-20_Tj4TomY8/TiXMvVsR1BI/AAAAAAAAAHU/oxM5W1Z0zSQ/s1600/website-alternatives.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;"><i>So many different &nbsp;options&#8230; which one to choose?</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table>At first I considered transferring everything to a hosted <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress blog</a> and purchase extra options such as the ability to use my own domain name, customs designs etc. But that seemed like an overkill, considering that I wouldn&#8217;t be using most of the features of a system like WordPress. I already have my main blog on Blogger, and I like it just the way it is.<br /><br />And yes, I could have just added a few extra pages to this <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> blog and use my domain to point directly to this blog, but I wanted to keep it as a separate place. After all, it already has several links pointing to its content (or so I like to think ;)), so I didn&#8217;t want to fix what wasn&#8217;t broken.<br /><br />I also didn&#8217;t want my domain to point to a profile on a social network, even though <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/11/how-to-build-an-audience-on-the-internet-the-kevin-rose-school-vs-the-fred-wilson-school/">I hear it&#8217;s fashionable</a> to direct your domain to <b>Google+</b> these days. Partly because I&#8217;m not a fan of Google+ yet, but mainly because I still wanted a more unique look and more flexibility when it comes to the content, design and layout of my hub.<br /><br />The next option I looked at were simple to use web builders, such as <a href="http://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> or <a href="http://www.moonfruit.com/">Moonfruit</a>. Both offer a simple web editor and the premium upgrade options for using your own domain and other goodies. I actually started recreating my old website in Weebly, but I felt the editor was a bit too limited (compared to the flexibility I was used to in iWeb), and I didn&#8217;t really like any of the templates.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Revisiting Tumblr as a personal website</span></b><br /><br />Then, finally, I decided to have a closer look at <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, a minimalistic blogging platform that has been getting a lot of attention lately. I&#8217;ve had a Tumblr blog (ialja.tumblr.com) since January 2009 and I occasionally used it to share different types of content. I&#8217;ve always liked it because it was simple to use and allowed me to share smaller bites of content that were&#8217;t full sized blog posts, but yet I could share more in a Tumblr post than I can on Twitter.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OqUvRM-TH5M/TiWduOqx_qI/AAAAAAAAAHA/c7QOUmuTSQ8/s1600/tumblr-post.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="91" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OqUvRM-TH5M/TiWduOqx_qI/AAAAAAAAAHA/c7QOUmuTSQ8/s400/tumblr-post.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I&#8217;ve read people were using Tumblr as their personal websites, so I was curious to see what I could turn my existing Tumblr blog into. I know I could add static pages to the blog, but was there a way to make the blog look less like a blog and more like an online hub? In other words, was there a way to display some static content right on the first page without the latest post getting all the attention?<br /><br />As it turn out, the answer was yes. You just have to find the right theme.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Tumblr&#8217;s secret sauce: powerful, great looking themes</span></b><br /><br />Tumblr has many great features that are making it <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/15/tumblr-surpasses-wordpress/">increasingly popular</a>, such as&nbsp;the simple, yet powerful editor for content of different types and the dashboard that makes it really easy to reshare, like and follow content posted by members of the Tumblr community. But one of my personal favorite features of Tumblr is the rich <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/themes/">Theme Garden</a>, which features all sorts of&nbsp;amazing looking themes.<br /><br />Tumblr themes aren&#8217;t just pretty to look at, but can also help you to use Tumblr for different purposes. There are themes for designers/photographers that can turn Tumblr into a <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-10-free-tumblr-themes-create-portfolio/">portfolio</a>, professional looking themes for <a href="http://www.sparkplugdigital.com/blog/an-introduction-to-tumblr-for-business/">business websites</a> and much more. And here&#8217;s the best part: you can get a lot of great looking themes for free!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ES09_CAkQk/TiXKFJUqpvI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/L0hB8HDndC0/s1600/tumblr-themes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="323" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1ES09_CAkQk/TiXKFJUqpvI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/L0hB8HDndC0/s400/tumblr-themes.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">A few examples of Tumblr themes</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Ok, I confess: I spent quite a few hours browsing through different themes in the Theme Garden and on different websites. I&#8217;ve never imagined I&#8217;d have so much fun playing virtual dress up with my blog! But there&#8217;s also another thing you should take into consideration when choosing your Tumblr theme: the customization and advanced options it provides.<br /><br />For instance, I was looking for a theme that would let me choose custom colors for links and titles, had the ability to easily add Disqus for comments, and my Google Analytics tracking ID. Yes, you can also do all that by fiddling with custom HTML, but why bother if you can find an awesome theme that does all that work for you?<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The Single A Tumblr Theme: sticky post, featured tag and more</span></b><br /><br />Well, lo and behold, at the end I ended up finding the perfect theme for just what I was looking for. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://singleatheme.tumblr.com/">Single A Theme</a>, it&#8217;s free (!), and provides some features that I haven&#8217;t found in any other Tumblr theme and lots of cool customization options. The key feature of this theme is certainly the ability to have a sticky post at the top of the blog - perfect for an online hub!<br /><br />So, here&#8217;s how my online hub <a href="http://ialja.com/">iAlja.com</a> looks now with this great theme:<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KKWPUqBtHEE/TiWe09gToQI/AAAAAAAAAHI/0qxTMiSrF90/s1600/ialja-new-website.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="302" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KKWPUqBtHEE/TiWe09gToQI/AAAAAAAAAHI/0qxTMiSrF90/s400/ialja-new-website.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">New, simple look for my online hub&nbsp;</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>It&#8217;s simple, it has just the colors I wanted, and it works. I&#8217;m using the sticky post feature of the theme to display an intro text with all the key links at the top, and I also use Tumblr&#8217;s Pages to display static content from my old website (<a href="http://ialja.com/about">About</a>, <a href="http://ialja.com/featured">Featured Work</a>). In addition to that, I&#8217;ve also added a link to this blog in the menu, so it&#8217;s easily accessible from any page.<br /><br />The theme also allows me to display me latest tweets in the sidebar, and I can use the Tumblr blog to post quick thoughts or interesting content I come across. For longer posts, such as this one, I still use my main Blogger blog, and then just post a link to the post on the Tumblr blog.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W0K3m46MTNQ/TiXICE4M1SI/AAAAAAAAAHM/wF5EezYpMoY/s1600/single-a-customization-tumblr.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W0K3m46MTNQ/TiXICE4M1SI/AAAAAAAAAHM/wF5EezYpMoY/s400/single-a-customization-tumblr.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">Single A Theme: l</span></i><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #999999;">ots of customization options&nbsp;</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">Thumbs up for Tumblr!</span></b><br /><br />All in all, I&#8217;m really happy with this solution and with my newly discovered online home. I found Tumblr to be flexible enough, while simple to use. Yes, it might take a little while to find the perfect theme, but once it&#8217;s set up, you can just focus on posting content.<br /><br />It&#8217;s so simple, I even decided to open another Tumblr blog dedicated to <a href="http://runjourney.tumblr.com/">running</a>. The fact that it&#8217;s ok to share bite size content on Tumblr encourages me to share more, and to do it faster, without getting in the way.<br /><br />So, if you&#8217;re looking for a simple way of sharing content that you can make your own with a unique look, and a great community on top of that, Tumblr is definitely the way to go. Thumbs up for Tumblr!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/07/making-tumblr-my-online-home.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/07/making-tumblr-my-online-home.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Recently I was invited to prepare a guest lecture for a small group of business and management students attending an E-learning course as part of their Summer School in Koper. I was told to choose a topic that would be fresh, something that students don&#8217;t get to hear about that often in regular classes.<br /><p>And that&#8217;s why I decided to put together an <b>overview of some of the key trends in the mobile industry</b> that are already influencing the way we study, work and socialize, and will probably be an increasingly important part of our day to day life. You can find the slides and the video of my lecture, as well as a text recap, in this post.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aUbDxvFBiA/ThYi-IEQddI/AAAAAAAAAG4/JeD6QsZPcPQ/s1600/mobile_trends_lecture-ialja.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2aUbDxvFBiA/ThYi-IEQddI/AAAAAAAAAG4/JeD6QsZPcPQ/s1600/mobile_trends_lecture-ialja.jpg" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Lecture slides with additional resources</span></span></b><br /><br />Because choosing just a few trends, just a few technologies wasn&#8217;t easy, I decided to prepare slides that students could also use to explore parts of the lecture they found most interesting in more details. That is why I added a lot of links to current articles with cases studies, stats, analysis and what not. You can view all of the slides embedded below.<br /><div id="__ss_8505250" style="width: 510px;"><strong style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/5-key-mobile-trends-youshould-know-about" target="_blank" title="5 key mobile trends you should know about">5 key mobile trends you&nbsp;should know about</a></strong> <iframe frameborder="0" height="426" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/8505250" width="510"></iframe> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a> </div></div><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Don&#8217;t like flipping through slides? Here&#8217;s a recap.</span></span></b><br /><br />To sum it all up in a more coherent form, here are the 5 key mobile trends I decided to highlight:<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">1. Mobile devices are making learning (and other activities) more magical</span></b><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rdamdLBTkgI/ThYe6jYoreI/AAAAAAAAAGk/uKosOTlfIS0/s1600/magic_touch_apple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rdamdLBTkgI/ThYe6jYoreI/AAAAAAAAAGk/uKosOTlfIS0/s1600/magic_touch_apple.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">The magic of touch (source: </span></span></i><a href="http://www.apple.com/education/"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Apple</span></span></i></a><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">)</span></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Interactive content is nothing new. What is new is the way mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets (that include smart sensors and touch screens) allow us to physically touch the content. It does feel a bit like magic, touching just isn&#8217;t the same as clicking with a mouse. It&#8217;s more intuitive, more personal. It gets to you.<br /><br />And while today apps like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-edAGLokak">Our Choice</a> are often seen as fun gimmicks that you can use to impress an audience, I believe that in a few years we&#8217;ll wonder how we&#8217;ve ever settled for learning with content we couldn&#8217;t touch directly. Ok, make that a couple of more years; we all know most edu folks aren&#8217;t exactly early adopters. But I believe that someday the shift will happen, because touch just feels so natural to all of us. <br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">2. Apps and app stores are rocking the world</span></b><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OrnOm-kUMp8/TXJ1CCZiP3I/AAAAAAAAAs8/qbLafMHHrDE/s1600/iPad-apps.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OrnOm-kUMp8/TXJ1CCZiP3I/AAAAAAAAAs8/qbLafMHHrDE/s1600/iPad-apps.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">The App Store has over 400,000 apps (source: </span></span></i><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Apple</span></span></i></a><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">)</span></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>There certainly is an app and an app store for that - whatever your &#8220;that&#8221; might be. Apart from satisfying our desire to help <a href="http://www.rovio.com/index.php?page=angry-birds">angry birds</a> get revenge on those naughty, egg-stealing pigs, mobile apps (and the development ecosystem Apple envisioned) are teaching everyone some important lessons. There are many reasons why apps are so successful. The most obvious one is because they are just so much more awesome and magical, if you will, than our desktop software.<br /><br />But another very important lesson (one that Apple already learned with the iTunes Store) is that we don&#8217;t mind paying for digital content if it&#8217;s easy and convenient to do so and if the content provides us with enough value. And, on the other side of the fence, we are eager to develop good content  if we get the chance to earn a few bucks and be the coolest kid in town aka the app store of our choice.<br /><br />The application stores are also making business models that rely on selling virtual content (in-app purchases) more popular and widely acceptable. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m stretching it too far if I predict that in a few year we&#8217;ll be spending 99 cents on fancy templates for Microsoft Office.

It seem like we&#8217;ve got no choice but to adapt to seeing our desktops becoming some sort of clumsier mobile device with a big screen.<br /><br />Not to mention websites also all want to look like apps. And <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/">HTML5</a>, CSS3 &amp; co. will make that all possible. Expect to see more websites that look and behave like apps or at least websites that will be smart enough to have the decency to self adjust to your screen size and even device type. I sure do hope to see more responsive design on the web in the coming years.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">4.

Where to start? It&#8217;s pretty clear that adding location data can make many services more useful and even fun. From local searches that help you discover cool nearby places, to the phenomena of telling all your friends not just what you&#8217;re doing, but also <i>where</i> you&#8217;re doing it and getting specials or offers in return, mobile payments and mobile commerce taking off, geo-fences that enable location reminds, ad-hoc social networks based on location, and&#8230; and&#8230; and&#8230;<br /><br />There is A LOT going on, so I really suggest you take a look at some of those additional links provided in the slide deck above. There&#8217;s no doubt that relying on location data to enhance services is a big trend that is just starting to evolve. As a side note, it is of course also worth noting that we have a lot of open questions about privacy and trust to figure out yet, especially when it comes to sensitive location data.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #3d85c6;">5.

The new wave of cloud services from all the big boys are all trying to making it easy for us to access our content, data and files from any of the devices we own.<br /><br />And while most people, who today know very well computers just aren&#8217;t to be trusted, are still skeptical of all these promises (it does look a bit like science fiction, doesn&#8217;t it?), I think in a few years we&#8217;ll all get adjusted to things just working seamlessly through the cloud. <br /><br />And that is probably the master trend to rule them all - the technology is slowly getting out of the way, fading in the background, while allowing us to be the forgetful, spontaneous, touch fixated human beings that we all are.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/11piubpwiqubf06/event/">Apple Keynote at WWDC 2011</a> was full of big announcements. No shiny hardware upgrades this time, but a lot of great stuff coming up for our desktops with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X Lion</a>, our mobile devices with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/">iOS 5</a> and a solution to keep it all nicely synced together, <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;m still digesting all the new announcements, but here&#8217;s one particular feature of iOS 5 that I think could really be a huge hit in our classrooms: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios5/features.html#more"><b>AirPlay Mirroring</b></a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QEbEDSeQPHI/Te3XtGlWBPI/AAAAAAAAADo/5Q5liiyUmKw/s1600/airplay2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QEbEDSeQPHI/Te3XtGlWBPI/AAAAAAAAADo/5Q5liiyUmKw/s320/airplay2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>AirPlay Mirroring brings the ability to mirror your <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> screen through <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a>. You can see a short demo in the video I&#8217;ve embedded below.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fp14M7yQV-0#t=3m46s" width="560"></iframe></div><p>Now, imagine this setting: instead of hooking your classroom overhead projector to the painfully slow computer on the teacher&#8217;s desk, connect it to the $99 Apple TV. And then use AirPlay Mirroring on your iPad to share presentations, your web browser or any of the 90,000 (!) beautiful <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/education.html">apps for the iPad</a>.</p>And the best thing? You&#8217;re free to walk around the classroom and let your students interact with the apps. <br /><br />There are of course already several iPad apps that can help you turn your tablet into an <a href="http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2011/03/24/ipad-as-an-interactive-white-board-for-5-or-10/">inexpensive, portable interactive white board</a>, but with this set up you could do so much more. It&#8217;s not limited to an app - you can do anything you can do on your iPad. Not to mention the setup is super portable, so you can take it along to any classroom you visit, not just at your own school.<br /><br />Unfortunately, AirPlay Mirroring isn&#8217;t out yet; it will be available in fall with the release of iOS 5. But I still think we&#8217;ll be seeing some nice uses of iPads hooked up to the not very expensive Apple TVs through AirPlay Mirroring. Bringing the magic of the iPad to the classrooms or meeting rooms, enabling people to work together just by passing the tablet around the room.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/06/ipad-airplay-mirroring-and-apple-tv-new.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/06/ipad-airplay-mirroring-and-apple-tv-new.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

I was really happy to see that <a href="http://twitter.com/salvetore"><b>Michael de Raadt</b></a> had the same idea and actually turned it into an awesome Moodle block that allows students to keep track of their progress in Moodle courses. The block is very flexible, works with Moodle 2.0 Completion tracking and you can have multiple instances of the block in your course (e.g. for each week or topic). The first sample of students also seemed pretty satisfied with this tool, so I highly encourage everyone to give this block a try - you can get it for free from the <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?rid=2524">Moodle Modules and plugins database</a>.<br /><div id="__ss_7774753" style="width: 425px;"><b style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/deraadt/time-management-in-moodle" title="Time management in Moodle"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">Time management in Moodle</span></a></b> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="355" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/7774753" width="425"></iframe> </span><br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">View more </span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">presentations</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"> from </span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/deraadt"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">deraadt</span></a> </div></div><span style="font-size: small;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span">4) Cool tool that plays nice with Moodle: BigBlueButton</span></span></b></span><br /><br />I was also impressed by <b><a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton</a></b> (BBB), presented by Fred Dixon. BBB is an open source web conferencing system with a clear focus on the educational market. They also put a lot on emphasis on keeping the whole thing simple to use, guarantee a simple installation and setup, and provide a nice integration with Moodle 1.9 and 2.0. I like the fact that they are not competing with Moodle, but rather trying to provide a quality product for supporting synchronous activities that you don&#8217;t usually get to do in Moodle. I&#8217;ll certainly keep an eye on BBB, and who knows - perhaps the next iMoot will be running on BBB instead of Adobe Connect.<br /><br /><a href="http://bigbluebutton.org/" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D_Yma1m33tA/Tb_vkHykjsI/AAAAAAAAAvk/KptQuTFmZFU/s400/BBB-screen.jpg" width="400" /></a><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">5) Cool Moodle 2 feature: Community hubs</span></span></b></span><br /><br />Moodle 2.0 comes with several new features and improvements to existing tools. But perhaps the single most potentially game changing feature is the addition of Community hubs, which were introduced at iMoot by <b><a href="http://tomazlasic.net/">Tomaz Lasic</a></b>. In a way, Community hubs provide an open marketplace for Moodle course, but they also provide a space for collaboration. You can have your own private community hubs connecting just a few schools, or make your courses available to the global Moodle community by publishing them on the <a href="http://hub.moodle.org/">Moodle.org Open Community Hub</a> (MOOCH).<br /><br />By connecting to a hub you don&#8217;t give away your user data and such, but just allow others to view or download your courses (your choice). You&#8217;re in complete control of what courses you want to publish and what kind of license you want to use. Go on, visit <a href="http://hub.moodle.org/">MOOCH</a> and take a look at some of the first courses that are have already been posted! And oh, if you want to try out community hubs and other cool Moodle 2.0 feature, head over to <a href="http://school.demo.moodle.net/">Mount Orange Moodle 2.0 Demo site</a>, where you can play around with a sample Moodle 2 installation in different roles.<br /><br />And below you can see an older version of Tomaz&#8217;s presentation - I&#8217;ll update it as soon as the new one with a more detailed explanation of community hubs is posted. <br /><div id="__ss_5791369" style="width: 425px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b style="display: block; margin: 12px 0pt 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/moodlefan/moodle-5791369" title="Moodle 2.0 Community hubs">Moodle 2.0 Community hubs</a></b></span> <span style="font-size: x-small;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="355" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/5791369" width="425"></iframe></span> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/moodlefan">Tomaz Lasic</a></span> </div></div><br /><span style="font-size: small;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span">6) Biggest Moodle 2 mystery: Where are my course files?</span></span></b></span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.markdrechsler.com/">Mark Drechsler</a> did a great job at uncovering the inconvenient truth behind the way Moodle 2 manages files.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jhE_1Fh05Es/Tb_hCJnNIKI/AAAAAAAAADY/qCDNXGE3tAA/s1600/imoot-logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 7px; margin-left: 7px;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jhE_1Fh05Es/Tb_hCJnNIKI/AAAAAAAAADY/qCDNXGE3tAA/s1600/imoot-logo.png" /></a></div><p>In the <a href="/2011/05/imoot-2011-highlights-part-1.html">previous post</a> I highlighted some of my favorite presentations from this year&#8217;s <a href="http://2011.imoot.org/"><b>iMoot</b></a>, a <b>web based international conference</b> dedicated to <a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle</a>, an open-source learning management system. The <b>4 day event ran 24 hours a day</b> to accommodate all time zones and was packed with <b>50+ speakers</b> across 6 continents. So, how does it feel to attend such event purely online?</p>First of all, I would like to thank and applaud the iMoot organizers for putting together such an amazing event. <a href="http://moodleman.moodle.com.au/">Julian Ridden</a> and his team worked hard day and night to make sure everything was running smoothly and everyone had the necessary support. And if you&#8217;re wondering what it takes to orchestrate such an event, just take a look at Julian&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://yfrog.com/gycqgqsj">iMoot Control Room</a>&#8221;.  <br /><br />The <b>program</b> was well planned and ran simultaneously in two tracks. There was just enough time to catch a little break between sessions, plenty of opportunities to interact with the presenters, and the repeat sessions made it possible to attend almost every session I was interested in in person.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ew0qQ5Ch_0Y/Tb_ogKhQidI/AAAAAAAAAvg/tlxCyT5eDGc/s1600/imoot-session-space.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ew0qQ5Ch_0Y/Tb_ogKhQidI/AAAAAAAAAvg/tlxCyT5eDGc/s1600/imoot-session-space.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666666; font-size: x-small;"><i>Basic options for every iMoot session</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table>By  the way - all repeat sessions were done live, not with recordings of the previous session! And in case you missed the repeat, you still have the chance to watch the recording on the conference website, usually posted within the day after the session.<br /><br />I also got a lot of opportunities to <b>practice Moodle 2.0</b> on the conference site, and the organizers did a great job at providing a <b>dynamic conference schedule</b> (custom coded by <a href="http://twitter.com/ikawhero">Shane Elliott</a>). The schedule showed your local time for all sessions and made switching between sessions a breeze. You could even save it and print it as a PDF file in case you wanted to have it on paper. <br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kdfk2Pkuqe4/Tb_itYSF4rI/AAAAAAAAADc/mYpolUuB7yw/s1600/iMoot_programme.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="296" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kdfk2Pkuqe4/Tb_itYSF4rI/AAAAAAAAADc/mYpolUuB7yw/s400/iMoot_programme.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Awesome dynamic schedule with all session links on the iMoot site</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>I must say it was a bit confusing to have a <b>separate course for each session</b>, particularly because each session had its own discussion forum in its own course, so there wasn&#8217;t much discussion going on on these individual forums - after all, it is difficult to follow forums in over 60 courses. It must be said that some presenters did a great job at adding extra resources to their courses and even used them for demos during presentations.<br /><br />So, the main place for <b>asynchronous discussions</b> was the iMoot Lounge, though most discussions were related to the technical issues and questions/comments about the program. That&#8217;s why I think it might be perhaps a good idea to have session discussion all in one place, perhaps right in the Lounge, so we&#8217;d all be exposed to more content oriented discussions.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c0WkYqtMZNo/Tb_levua03I/AAAAAAAAADk/35KqK09En7o/s1600/imoot-lounge.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="316" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-c0WkYqtMZNo/Tb_levua03I/AAAAAAAAADk/35KqK09En7o/s400/imoot-lounge.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">iMoot 2011 conference lounge</span></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>But of course, as with face-to-face conferences, most of the interaction took place during the live sessions. All presentations, panels and keynotes were delivered through <b>Adobe Connect</b>, a professional web conferencing solution, which is relatively easy to use and set up (note: I have used the system before in different roles, so I came prepared). Yes, there were some technical problems along the way, particularly in sessions with over 40 participants, when we&#8217;d all get occasionally kicked from the session room. It kinda reminded me of Second Life events with sims crashing and all (good old times!).<br /><div style="text-align: right;"></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hl4IrWq_XdY/Tb_j7dSU1cI/AAAAAAAAADg/Vkvnzy2Yu_g/s1600/iMoot_Martin_keynote-s.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hl4IrWq_XdY/Tb_j7dSU1cI/AAAAAAAAADg/Vkvnzy2Yu_g/s400/iMoot_Martin_keynote-s.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Adobe Connect during Martin&#8217;s keynote</span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>But hey, it really wouldn&#8217;t be a real web conference without tech problems, would it? Plus, the support staff was very helpful and fast in solving any issues, so for the most part the technology did work as it should have and the sessions were easy to follow. I especially enjoyed the <b>lively backchat</b> during presentations that was usually both informative and fun, and provided a great opportunity to learn from one another.<br /><br />Big kudos also to all <b>presenters</b> that really engaged their audience in the presentation and did a great job at keeping an eye on the live Chat while presenting. I really feel we had more opportunities to ask questions and steer the direction of the presentation than we would in a face to face conference.<br /><br />So, regardless of whether you&#8217;re a Moodle pro or a Moodle beginning still exploring what Moodle can do, I <b>strongly recommend attending an (i)Moot</b>. It&#8217;s a great experience and wonderful opportunity to connect with Moodlers around the world, get direct feedback and insight from core Moodle developers, and learn tons of practical tips and tricks. Also, way more affordable than attending Moodle Moots around the world, though that&#8217;s of course also a great experience if you can afford it.<br /><br />And finally, to all fellow iMooters, class 2011: hope to see you again next year! Perhaps I&#8217;ll even find the time/courage to join in with my presenter hat as well :)<br /><br />Related post:<br /><ul><li> <a href="/2011/05/imoot-2011-highlights-part-1.html">iMoot 2011: the Highlights (Part 1)</a></li></ul><br /><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/05/imoot-2011-experience-part-2.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/05/imoot-2011-experience-part-2.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Sure, other tech gadgets and smartphone operating systems do tend to show a slight male bias, but why is the percentage of Android female users so dramatically low? And can anything be done to make Android more appealing to women?</p><br />These were the two key questions I tried to answer while searching for a topic to present at the recent <a href="http://mobilecamp.si/">MobileCamp Ljubljana</a>, Android edition. I was pretty sure more than three quarters of the audience at the event would be male (I was correct), so that seemed like a nice topic to explore with the guys, mostly app developers.<br /><br />You can see the slides from my talk embedded below. As the slides attracted quite some interest on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> (my first presentation that got featured on the homepage!), I also decided to do a little write-up on my blog, to expand on some of the key points.<br /><div id="__ss_7158585" style="width: 425px;"><strong style="display: block; margin: 12px 0 4px;"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/android-for-girls-a-new-frontier" title="Android for girls: a new frontier"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">Android for girls: a new frontier</span></a></strong> <object height="355" id="__sse7158585" width="425"> <param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=androidforgirlz-110305061532-phpapp02&stripped_title=android-for-girls-a-new-frontier&userName=ialja" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse7158585" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=androidforgirlz-110305061532-phpapp02&stripped_title=android-for-girls-a-new-frontier&userName=ialja" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed> </object> <br /><div style="padding: 5px 0 12px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">View more </span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">presentations</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;"> from </span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-small;">iAlja</span></a></div></div>So, why aren&#8217;t more girls using Android? What can we do to make Android phones feel right and not (only) a geek device?<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Who defines the user experience and perception of Android?</span></span></b><br /><br />Given the complexity of the Android ecosystem, we basically have three major groups of players that define the look and feel of Android:<br /><ul><li>On the basic level we have <b>Google defining core OS functionality and design</b>.</li><li>On the next level we have various <b>phone manufacturers</b> (HTC, Samsung, Motorola, Sony Ericsson etc.), who define the <b>hardware characteristics</b> of the devices and can also create <b>their own user interface modifications and software modifications</b>. Together with mobile operators, they&#8217;re also the ones that make sure end-users buy their Android devices through ads and promotions.</li><li>And finally, on top level, we have <b>application developers</b>, who create apps that <b>enhance the functionality of Android phones</b>.</li></ul><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Android as an operating system</span></span></b><br /><br />Without any doubt, Google has a &#8220;cool&#8221; status among geeks. We all love free Google services, and the geeks and hackers rejoiced at the announcement of Android, Google&#8217;s &#8220;open&#8221; alternative to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;evil&#8221; iPhone walled garden.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vfMPaEgdGtM/TXYLX80qqtI/AAAAAAAAAuU/obEsiQNzXig/s1600/android-system-architecture.jpg" /></a></div><br />In some aspects, Android is trying hard to imitate iOS (the operating system running on iPhones), but on the other hand, it does provide users, manufacturers and developers a bit more freedom when it comes to customizing your device. Ask any true Android geek, and they&#8217;ll tell you how awesome their Android phone is if you just install the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/#!5596108/how-to-choose-the-right-android-rom-for-you">right ROM</a> (a modified version of the OS).<br /><br />Wait, what? Yeah, it does sound a lot like listening to Linux fans. And we all know that your typical Linux users is certainly not female. Well, the same problem seems to apply to Android. Perhaps the manufacturers, with their unique user interfaces, can make Android look prettier to girls?<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Android as a product</span></b></span><br /><br />Well, sort of. To be fair, some manufacturers are really trying to make Android easier to use for us, common people, and not just the geeks, who have the unstoppable urge to hack everything with a chip.<br /><br />For instance, HTC is really trying hard to make Android devices friendly little helpers through <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/htcsense/index.html">HTC Sense</a>. It can do some pretty nifty tricks like ringing louder when it&#8217;s tucked in our bags or displaying friends&#8217; latest Facebook status update when they call, so you can instantly tell it&#8217;s their birthday.<br /><br />But then, you get ads for Android devices like the following one for Motorola&#8217;s Droid. Let&#8217;s watch it together:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/w83UQkiuNZQ" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Oh yeah! 30 seconds of pure, raw manpower. Did you get the chance to grab a beer?<br /><br />Ok, to be fair, it&#8217;s not a new ad, and some of Motorola&#8217;s recent ads are a bit more neutral. But the ad above is an extreme case of a trend we often see when manufacturers and mobile operators promote their Android devices: too much emphasis on technical specifications and forgetting the human touch.<br /><br />Motorola&#8217;s Xoom Super Bowl ad was a bit better at making their Android device look more human friendly, but their final tagline still reads <i>&#8220;The world first Android 3.0 tablet&#8221;</i>. Yawn!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8BPFODsob1I" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Now, dear Motorola (and others), do watch how you make ads that focus on the experience and human emotion:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6CRfHl1Glwk" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />But of course, to make ads like this, you also need products that focus on the end-user, who is not necessarily a geek or a hacker.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Android and apps - the Market(ing) problem</span></span></b><br /><br />So finally, we reach the apps, the final piece of any modern smartphone puzzle that can make or break the user experience. Here is when I came across some interesting research; <a href="http://wallblog.co.uk/2010/07/07/women-twice-as-likely-as-men-to-never-have-downloaded-an-app/">according to The Wall Blog</a>, <b>women with smartphones (not such a minority anymore) are&nbsp;twice as likely as men to never have downloaded an app</b>. Hm, that&#8217;s a huge gap.<br /><br />When asked for reasons, some of the most common answers given by women were that the they felt overwhelmed by the choice of apps, and that apps were not relevant to them because they didn&#8217;t help them or enhanced their lives. So, we clearly have a marketing problem when it comes to selling apps, especially to women.<br /><br />My guess is that this problem is more pronounced in the Android Market, where, due to the lack of strict guidelines, it&#8217;s more difficult to find quality apps. Apple is trying to make app discovery easier by providing curated selections of apps.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kQWDNupkGUI/TXYL8Xk7XmI/AAAAAAAAAuc/NvFJ3ZwUEHw/s1600/apple-apps-for-parents.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kQWDNupkGUI/TXYL8Xk7XmI/AAAAAAAAAuc/NvFJ3ZwUEHw/s1600/apple-apps-for-parents.jpg" /></a></div><br />For a good example of this, visit the Apps for iPhone section on Apple&#8217;s website, where apps for different needs, such as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-everything/momsdads.html">Apps for Moms and Dads</a>,&nbsp;are clearly presented with big pictures and short descriptions. And you can be pretty sure that apps that make it to this page have been thoroughly tested and will probably make a good purchase.<br /><br />And that is what Android Market could really use. But who will be brave enough to attempt such a massive feat of strength? And how will users find such content, when most of them probably aren&#8217;t looking for specialized blogs and sites on the subject? Apple certainly has the advantage of being the one and only company to make their phone, market it and sell apps for it through their own App Store.<br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">What do women want from mobile apps?</span></span></b><br /><br />The big question for all app developers is, of course, what do women want from mobile apps? How can we make apps that women will want to download?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n77AvXbMv_U/TXYMZbJmPkI/AAAAAAAAAug/9UQ43dsNzCk/s1600/iStock_000005891287Medium+Woman+Bench.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n77AvXbMv_U/TXYMZbJmPkI/AAAAAAAAAug/9UQ43dsNzCk/s1600/iStock_000005891287Medium+Woman+Bench.jpg" /></a></div><br />I found a really good answer to this on the <a href="http://www.handshake20.com/2010/11/this-womans-gotta-have-mobile-apps-.html">Handshake 2.0 blog</a>, where&nbsp;Maureen Carruthers writes about what she&#8217;s looking for in mobile apps (emphasis mine):<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">&#8220;The ﬁnal quality of my favorite apps is </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">how they make me feel - about myself</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. &#8230; these apps help me feel </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">loved, well-read and prepared</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. &#8230; Most importantly, they are intuitive, so they <b>n</b></span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">ever make me feel stupid</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. No matter how potentially amazing an app may be, if I can’t easily ﬁgure it out, it will gather virtual dust.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></i></div><br />Another <a href="http://www.handshake20.com/Women_and_Mobile_Apps_Survey_Piedmont_Research_Associates.pdf">survey among female mobile app users</a> came to the conclusion that (emphasis mine):<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">“</span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Women want to </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">be connected</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. They want to </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">be informed</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">. They want apps that </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">help them through the day</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">, whether it is comparison shopping, turn-by-turn directions, or a way to be more organized.”</span></i></div><br />So, we don&#8217;t want clutter, we don&#8217;t need extra bling - we want apps that are easy to use and that makes our lives better or easier! Women are probably more likely than men to see their phones as tools that shouldn&#8217;t require a manual, but should provide clear value in everyday life.<br /><br />Of course, this doesn&#8217;t apply to just women - many users outside the geeky, tech crowd feel the same! And here&#8217;s my advice for app developers: <b>focus on everyday usability and experience, not on fancy algorithms and tech talk</b>.<br /><br />Instagram, for instance, is a good examples of a great mobile app service that isn&#8217;t anything special from the technological point of view, but it does provide great experience and community. And that&#8217;s what counts for most users, not necessarily just women.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--y7jXcdkklc/TXJ0R_rhiLI/AAAAAAAAAs4/VDF-SS_ZO_s/s1600/ipad-education.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="120" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--y7jXcdkklc/TXJ0R_rhiLI/AAAAAAAAAs4/VDF-SS_ZO_s/s200/ipad-education.jpg" width="150" /></a></div><p><a href="/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7-facts.html">In part 1</a>, I talked about my personal experience with three of the most popular operating systems for mobile devices of today and the future. In this post, I&#8217;d like to continue my analysis by looking at which OS has the biggest potential to become a hit product of our classrooms.</p><br />So, we have three main contenders running for classroom OS of the year:<br /><ul><li><b>iOS</b>, the app focused OS running on incredibly sexy Apple mobile devices,</li><li><b>Android</b>, the geeky OS of many choices and opportunities that can even be installed on an e-book reader and</li><li><b>Windows Phone 7</b>, Microsoft&#8217;s attempt to catch up by focusing on a simple user experience (and making Apple fans feel bad for liking a Windows device).</li></ul><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">What the school is looking for</span></span></b><br /><br />And we&#8217;re at Sunnydale High School. Helen, the principal, really wants to make their school cool and fun by providing their students and teachers with one-to-one technology. After all, it&#8217;s so hard to capture students&#8217; attention these days, and being proficient with computers will surely give students a competitive edge in the information society of the future.<br /><br />But here&#8217;s the thing: the school is on a really tight budget and they have to decide what to invest in. Should they install interactive blackboards in every classroom? Get a computer in every classroom? Give each student their own computer?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jnYoB9KgTy4/TXJ6RjVWPtI/AAAAAAAAAtY/x60voSiDGxw/s1600/thinking_person.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jnYoB9KgTy4/TXJ6RjVWPtI/AAAAAAAAAtY/x60voSiDGxw/s1600/thinking_person.jpg" /></a></div><br />That&#8217;s all very expensive, and the investment they made in those tiny netbooks two years ago didn&#8217;t really pay off. Nobody likes them. The teachers hate them because the screens are so tiny and because Word is so slow to use. The students hate them because they are slower than the computers they have at home and because even their phones provide a better Facebook experience. And the IT stuff hates them because they are just as annoying to maintain and support as their big brothers in the computer lab. So, the netbooks are mostly collecting dust in the closets. or being used as paperweight - at least something they&#8217;re sort of good at.<br /><br />Is the answer in those new mobile, post-PC devices everyone keeps talking about? Let&#8217;s take a look!<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The smartphones</span></span></b><br /><br />There is one big problem with using smartphones in classrooms: most students don&#8217;t have them (yet) and schools probably can&#8217;t afford to be buying phones for their students, as the prices are quite steep without a contract with a mobile operator.<br /><br />In a few years, when smartphones become common place, sure, they might become great learning aids in classroom, but until them we&#8217;ll probably see them used as personal learning tools by students with the privilege of owning one. Unless mobile operators start making deals with schools, of course, which is not probably not something we can put our money on.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/index.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2rtNrLvfqgg/TXJ7gOAN0uI/AAAAAAAAAtc/gSVjHNSF5Nk/s1600/ultimate_thesaurus-web.jpg" /></a></div>And even when most students have smartphones, the biggest potential might not be in their operating systems and native apps, but in <b>web apps</b> that students on any mobile platform with a modern browser can use. Even Apple already has a nice webpage dedicated to touch ready <a href="http://www.apple.com/webapps/whatarewebapps.html">Web apps</a>. Truth be told, web apps are probably more convenient for schools than managing native mobile apps (especially paid ones). The only requirement for schools here is a reliable WiFi network that can handle hundreds of concurrent devices.<br /><br />Microsoft did however showcase an interesting glimpse into the future of connected devices with a Windows Phone 7 integration with Kinect, a system that allows Xbox users to control games with body movements. The video below looks like pure fun, but just imagine transferring this idea to a classroom full of students and enable them to interact with software with a combination of body movements and touch inputs on various mobile devices.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ehS-AfM4b8I" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br /><b><i>Verdict:</i></b><i> Smartphones are probably not a viable option for most classrooms yet. However, as smartphones with modern browsers become more commonplace, web apps might have the biggest potential because they are platform independent. Just make sure to have a good WiFi network in place to avoid expensive data charges. Another interesting opportunity will be brought by the ability of smartphones to connect to other devices and form a rich interaction network based on natural inputs.</i><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The smartphones minus the phone</span></span></b><br /><br />The next category of devices to look at is the smartphones without the ability to connect to cellphone networks i.e. mainly Apple&#8217;s <b><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iPod Touch</a></b>. It&#8217;s got most of the goodies of its big brother, the iPhone 4, but at less than half its price.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ipodtouch-iphone/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uMTq3IgqHhQ/TXJ4Wi0y2nI/AAAAAAAAAtM/_gIhqWNEhQM/s1600/ipod_touch-apps_edu.jpg" /></a></div>The drawback is that you have to rely on WiFi networks for internet connectivity. Luckily, these are getting increasingly popular at more and more places, and practically all schools I&#8217;ve visited recently have at least some sort of WiFi network of their own.<br /><br />And the iPod Touch also brings an important advantage to the table: there are already several documented studies of successful uses of iPod Touches (and even the less capable devices in the iPod family) in classrooms. And Apple even provides a special <a href="http://images.apple.com/education/docs/Apple-iPodGettingStartedGuide081809.pdf">PDF&nbsp;guide for using iPod touch and iTunes for teaching and learning</a>.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YPchHSt5tPQ/TXJ406w6mkI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/54MLlmaeVtY/s1600/ipod_touch-itunesU.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YPchHSt5tPQ/TXJ406w6mkI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/54MLlmaeVtY/s1600/ipod_touch-itunesU.jpg" /></a></div>We&#8217;re probably all aware of the fact that podcasting has been in use for several years in education now, and that&#8217;s all the iPod Touch does extremely well. But it&#8217;s biggest strength are of course the apps. A lot of <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ipodtouch-iphone/">quality apps that can be used in classroom</a>.<br /><br />And while the school still needs to figure out ways to manage different iPod Touches and keep them all charged and synced, the updating process certainly is less of a hassle than on regular computer. There are <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1495">several ways</a> to use the same computer with different devices or have multiple devices linked to one iTunes account, a <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/education/">special program</a> for buying and distributing apps to students in volume, and even custom mobile labs (more on that later). However, having to sync Apple&#8217;s devices with iTunes is probably the biggest hassle iOS devices have, so that&#8217;s probably something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Ok, moving on to competitors. Hmmm. Ah, there is one - Samsung&#8217;s <b><a href="http://www.gadgetsandgizmos.org/samsung-galaxy-player-50-review/">Galaxy Player</a></b>, the first Android powered competitor to the iPod Touch. But here&#8217;s the thing - it&#8217;s not on the market yet. It will supposedly be a bit cheaper than the iPod Touch - both in price and hardware. So, let&#8217;s just wait to see this one on the market first and see how it does, ok?<br /><br />Right. So, we have Windows Phone 7 left. Sadly, as the name indicates, it&#8217;s a phone OS, so no real competition here either. On the other hand, we could include <b><a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/products/zunehd/default.htm">Zune HD</a></b>, Microsoft&#8217;s portable media player, in the mix, considering the experience is somehow similar to WP7.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_zWi67YPDNo/TXJ5aO-X3kI/AAAAAAAAAtU/oqHc1xUSkIs/s1600/zuneHD.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_zWi67YPDNo/TXJ5aO-X3kI/AAAAAAAAAtU/oqHc1xUSkIs/s1600/zuneHD.jpg" /></a></div>So, what does the Zune HD has to offer? Yes, music and video of course. What about apps? Aye, it has apps! How many? 42. And how many apps are there for the iPod Touch? About 350,000. Right, I rest my case.<br /><br /><b><i>Verdict:</i></b><i> The iPod Touch certainly is a big winner here with a proven track record of classroom excellence. It&#8217;s a great device for podcasting, and on top of that supports tons of quality educational apps. It will be very hard for competitors to catch up with this little gem anytime soon!</i><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;">The tablets</span></span></b><br /><br />Let&#8217;s just move to the next category of mobile device that will supposedly be a bit more crowded this year: the tablets. <br /><br />This week Apple announced the <b><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad 2</a></b>. Now thinner, faster, lighter, with cameras, 10-hour battery life, even more magic and the same starting price - $499. It&#8217;s the original iPad made better and there are over 65,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OrnOm-kUMp8/TXJ1CCZiP3I/AAAAAAAAAs8/qbLafMHHrDE/s1600/iPad-apps.jpg" /></a></div><br />The original iPad is already being used to enhance teaching and learning on all levels. For some inspiring examples, have a look at the short promo video on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/ipad/">Learning with iPad</a> site.&nbsp;And for schools, Apple is even offering incredibly sleek iPad Learning Labs (I want a cabinet filled with iPads too!), so it&#8217;s definitely a big plus to have various <a href="http://images.apple.com/education/docs/Apple-iOS-Learning-Solutions_20110218.pdf">iOS Learning Solutions</a> readily available.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/education/labs/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FdO-nCOVebI/TXJyD96zt0I/AAAAAAAAAs0/HPNAN2mCXwQ/s1600/ipad_labs_20110218.jpg" /></a></div>15 million&nbsp;iPads were sold all over the world in just 9 months, so there&#8217;s no doubt the new model will also be a hit. Probably the biggest challenge that Apple is facing with the iPad is how to ship enough units to satisfy the huge demand for this truly magical device - and that&#8217;s certainly a good problem to be having!<br /><br />Now, moving on to Android. The recent Mobile World Congress was full of new Android tablet announcements. The powerful Motorola Xoom, already on sale in the States, Samsung offering a new, iPad size 10 inch version of its Galaxy Tab, LG G-Slate, Acer Iconia Tabs, Asus Eee Pads, Dell Streak 10&#8230; They come in all shapes and sizes, varying from 7 to 10 inches. One thing they all have in common: <b>Android 3.0 Honeycomb</b>. The first version of Android designed specifically for tablets.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/XOOM/index.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-n4zcCXxtD6g/TXJ1X2KH_ZI/AAAAAAAAAtA/Y63WKen8Q-g/s1600/motorola_xoom.jpg" /></a></div>My first impression from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPUGNCIozp0">videos</a> and reviews? It looks&#8230; crowded. Yes, some elements are rather nice - the way it does multitasking, notifications. But it seems like it&#8217;s trying to borrow a bit too much from the desktop world. I especially wonder how that will work out on the smaller tablets. I haven&#8217;t had the chance to try out a Honeycomb device yet, as they are only starting to ship, so my opinion might change once I actually get to try a Honeycomb device first hand.<br /><br />But there is one big elephant in the Honeycomb room: the lack of apps for Android tablets. Sure, Honeycomb does a good job at scaling up apps made for Android smarphones of smaller sizes, but having apps designed for tablets in mind is a different story. Think <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-a-visual-exploration/id364147847?mt=8#">The Elements app</a> for the iPad.<br /><br />And here, yet again, <b>Apple has a massive head start</b>. Sure, in a year or two the number of Honeycomb apps will probably be more respectable, but for now, sitting around 100, the lack of apps remains it&#8217;s Achilles&#8217; heel.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/imovie.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Vfj-tyM36mo/TXJ1_TiG5rI/AAAAAAAAAtE/A8W1MMAAc7I/s1600/ipad-imovie.jpg" /></a></div>In the meantime, the iPad is getting new, amazing new apps every day. Like the mind blowing iPad versions of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/imovie.html">iMovie</a>&nbsp;(shown above) and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/from-the-app-store/garageband.html">Garage Band</a>&nbsp;made by Apple. I can&#8217;t imagine those two running on an Android tablet, but I surely can see those two apps being used by students all all ages in classrooms all over the world!<br /><br />So, the impression I get here is that the manufacturers will have to invest a lot of effort in making their Android tablets more user friendly. HTC, for instance, has showcased a pretty nifty notetaking app that works with Evernote on its 7 inch <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/flyer/overview.html">HTC Flyer</a> tablet (also just announced at the Mobile World Congress, not yet on the market). Not sure about the additional stylus, but it looks pretty interesting!<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/X8R11CNm9kI" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></div><br />Another interesting fact is that the HTC Flyer won&#8217;t ship with Honeycomb, but rather with Android 2.3 Gingerbread with a special edition of HTC Sense (HTC&#8217;s custom UI modification for Android) made just for tablets. HTC says a Honeycomb update is being worked on, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t help with the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20023199-264.html">Android fragmentation issues</a>.<br /><br />Now, the great thing about Android is its tight integration with Google services. And that could be a good selling point for Android tablets in education, as a lot of students already have Google Accounts, and a lot of schools might even be using Google Apps for Education already. Very convenient!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/edu/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DbRrfIFx4j8/TXJ29WukIcI/AAAAAAAAAtI/-ROAvsI_Va4/s1600/firstdayofschool09-hp.gif" /></a></div>It would be even more convenient if Google you could get Google Apps for Education in a big package with Android tablets, but unfortunately that is very unlikely considering that Google isn&#8217;t a hardware company. Which means that schools looking to buy Android tablets will have to do it on their own or get help from some other company (anyone aware of companies providing Google Apps and Android tablets bundles?).<br /><br />But let&#8217;s not forget <a href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/">App Inventor</a>, Google&#8217;s free and relatively easy to use tool for programming Android apps that is targeted at the educational market. Now, THAT looks interesting, but it&#8217;s surely not for every school at every level. It&#8217;s more of a niche candy that will hopefully attract students to Android development, which might someday result in better Android apps.<br /><br />So, Android does have some advantages, but at the same time the tablets are having a hard time matching iPad&#8217;s $499 starting price. For instance, the Motorola Xoom&#8217;s $800 (no contract) entry price is anything but compatible. Yes, it does Google services well, but there are still tons of other apps that are still missing.<br /><br />What about Windows Phone 7? Again, notice the phone in the name? Microsoft apparently wants your to have the WP7 experience on your smartphone only. And the <b>Windows tablets</b> will be running, well, Windows 7. Windows tablets have been on the market way before the iPad with little success. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oEPX9PN8uUA/TXJ-3Dy6z4I/AAAAAAAAAto/IBlM4UcxNQM/s1600/Pioneer-windows-7-tablet-pc_.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oEPX9PN8uUA/TXJ-3Dy6z4I/AAAAAAAAAto/IBlM4UcxNQM/s1600/Pioneer-windows-7-tablet-pc_.jpg" /></a></div><br />Sure, it&#8217;s a familiar environment for users, but so far it seems that users prefer a much more simpler OS on their portable devices, so I&#8217;m not really placing any bets on Windows 7 (or 8) tablets. Steve Jobs had this to say about tablets:&nbsp;“<a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/04/steve-jobs-post-pc-credo/">These are post-PC devices, that need to be even easier to use than a PC.</a>” Agreed.<br /><br /><b><i>Verdict:</i></b><i> It seems that 2011 will yet again be the year of the iPad. Yes, Android tablets have great integration with Google services most of already use, and the App Inventor is an interesting tool for learning and teaching programming, but the steep prices and the lack of apps are a major disappointment. Plus, most of the new Android tablets that have been announced are not on the market yet, so we&#8217;ll probably have to wait at least another year for a real Android tablet breakthrough. As to Microsoft, they&#8217;d better start thinking about how to make the tablet experience as pleasant as their new smartphone experience. Again, at least a year or more before that happens. In the mean time, the iPad might become just as iconic and commonplace as the iPods on the market for MP3 players.</i><br /><br /><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #e69138;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Which devices are classroom ready? Today?</span></span></b><br /><br />I think I&#8217;ve made it pretty clear that the market for smart mobile devices is far from mature. Apple is leading the way in practically every category and others are playing catch up. Sure, Android is rapidly gaining market share when it comes to smartphones (not surprisingly, considering the number and variety of devices), but the tablet market (much more interesting for education) is still in its infancy. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s1neteskxXQ/TXJ8Q3-0CxI/AAAAAAAAAtg/0qmkG73WkAA/s1600/iphone-ipad.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s1neteskxXQ/TXJ8Q3-0CxI/AAAAAAAAAtg/0qmkG73WkAA/s1600/iphone-ipad.png" /></a></div>Apple&#8217;s iOS devices - mainly the iPod Touch and the iPad - do however have one huge advantage: the <b>choice of quality apps and the affordable price</b>. Additionally, schools can even get convenient mobile learning labs with iOS devices, so they&#8217;re easier to manage.&nbsp;And that&#8217;s why I think that today the iPod Touch and the iPad are the best choice for classrooms - and for encouraging learning outside of classrooms as well.<br /><br />The Android tablets have been rather disappointing&nbsp;so far, though the situation might change when more Honeycomb tablets (and apps) become available on the market. But without apps that can compare to those already available for the iPad, the competition will be a rather boring one.<br /><br />So, for today, my vote certainly goes to the iPod Touch and the iPad (depending on your budget). I know I might sound like an Apple commercial, but these two devices are truly amazing to use, and the competition is still lagging behind. So, for now, I really can&#8217;t wait to get the new iPad and have tons of fun exploring all the new apps and learning new stuff along the way. What about your classroom?<br /><br /><a href="/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7-facts.html">&gt;&gt; iOS, Android and Windows Phone 7: the facts and my experience [Part 1]</a><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2011/03/ios-android-and-windows-phone-7.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
