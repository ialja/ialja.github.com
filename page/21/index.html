  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Since the first day I&#8217;ve found the work of an online tutor highly challenging and engaging. The biggest challenge for me is finding ways in which to direct and motivate students with their course activities, and getting to know individual needs and expectations of my students. At the end of the study year 2005/2006 I carried out a survey about student satisfaction with the work of their online tutor. In this post I&#8217;d like to present student opinions about my work, while a more detailed presentation of the survey will be included in my diploma (after I study some more advanced statistics ;) ).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">So, what did the students like most about my work?</span><br />(I picked some of the responses - the only change I made was the translation from Slovenian to English)<ul style="font-style: italic;"><li>An unobtrusive way of presenting information.</li><li>That the tutor participated whenever it was necessary and that she always helped us when we were stuck.</li><li>Kindness, immediate answers, professional attitude.</li><li>Objectivity.</li><li>The tutor&#8217;s interventions in our discussion were good and she guided us.</li><li>Encouraging words, quick response in case of problems, relaxed atmosphere.</li><li>That she always responded when she was asked to and when she sensed that we were going astray from out discussions or that she encouraged us when we despaired.</li><li>Actually, I got more than I expected.</li></ul>It is clear that students appreciate short response times, and a fair relationship. All this in my opinion helped them to get a sense of my constant presence and in a way make up for the physical and time separations among us. From my experience I can say that the trick of being a good online tutor is being with your students just when they need you most. Being online 24/7 is absolutely unnecessary - students don&#8217;t really notice your presence if they have no need for you; but they will notice your absence if you&#8217;re not with them in times of greatest needs (like approaching deadlines, first encounters with a new activities, major group conflicts etc). Also, it helps to give a sense of presence to occasionally write a few words of praise when the students are working well and on their own - just to let them know that you&#8217;re there and that you appreciate their work. For me the best compliment I got from my students was when a student asked me: &#8220;How many hours a day were you online? At least 8, right?&#8221; - when actually I was spending on average less then 1.5 hours a day in our virtual classroom. But of course - there were days when I was spending 3 whole hours just working with students online, and then there were days when I only spent half an hour in the virtual classroom.<br /><br />And here&#8217;s another trick - it&#8217;s better to log in the system a few times a day than to spend a certain amount of hours online once a day. The picture I made displays this concept. The red dots represent activities that require response, the rectangles (the color matches the color of the tutor) represent the time each tutor spends online - we can see that in the case of the Morning tutor (that is online online for X numbers in the mornings) the response time for certain activities is much longer than in the case of the Flexible tutor (that also works less because he responds to student needs).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/tutors.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/320/tutors.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>While I was tutoring the course, I checked for new posts AT LEAST 3 times a day - first thing in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening; and that is how I was able to quickly respond to all questions and all unexpected situations. And why is that so? Because one of the advantages of e-learning is the flexibility in time and space - students can freely choose when and where they will work from. Some do it when they get to the office in the morning, some do it in the afternoons, and some in late evening after they put their kids to bed. And if you as an online tutor want to be there for them you have to keep track of all these groups (luckily for me we don&#8217;t have students in different time zones or I&#8217;d probably be awoke by concern in the middle of the night to check the evening activities of american students and morning activities of asian students ;) ).<br /><br />Yes, being an online tutor (in my opinion) definitely isn&#8217;t a straight 8 hours work. In hours it may seem like you don&#8217;t too much, but you do have to work practically all day and even during weekends. Plus you have to predicts the needy situation that will require more of your attention, but in the end, for me, it&#8217;s a fun and exciting job as few others.<br /><br />And here are some of my favorite links related to the the subject of this post (alphabetically):<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clive Shepherd</span>: <a href="http://www.fastrak-consulting.co.uk/tactix/Features/perfect_etutor.htm" target="_blank">In search of the perfect e-tutor</a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LearnDirect</span>: <a href="http://www.learndirect-advice.co.uk/helpwithyourcareer/jobprofiles/profiles/profile1345/" target="_blank">Online tutor</a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maggie McPherson and Miguel Baptista Nunes</span>: <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/materials/contrib/2004/Maggie_MsP.html" target="_blank">The Role of Tutors as an Integral Part of Online Learning Support</a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scot Headley</span>: <a href="http://www.innovateonline.info/index.php?view=article&id=78&amp;action=article" target="_blank">Five Roles I Play in Online Courses</a></li></ul><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/tips-tricks-for-online-tutoring.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/tips-tricks-for-online-tutoring.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Marketing professionals are already aware of the importance of user attitudes towards products. User loyalty can be won by regularly exceeding user expectations and giving them just that extra bit more to create passionate and thus loyal users. Products that consumers mark as good are on a good path, but those that users mark as very good or even excellent have the potential of gaining user loyalty.<br /><br />And while most of the really successful companies are trying to catch up with the consumer centered production, or educational system is still ages behind. From my experience of formal education schools are run for school&#8217;s sake - meaning that they don&#8217;t really try to create knowledge, but to achieve preset goals that don&#8217;t really care about the participants (and here I mean both teachers and students). Teachers must &#8220;teach&#8221; a certain quantity of facts that students will forget in a few months anyway - but hey! the school&#8217;s plan was carried out! And the evaluation only takes place  a few times a year and few care to wonder if what is being taught is really being learnt.<br /><br />Surely, these days learner centered design is a big word, but (speaking from my personal experience) it is still too slow in catching up with real life education. And that is why I think it is important for educators to actively think about the needs of our students and share our experience with other educator - and more than ever the technology to do it is now at hand.<br /><br />Blogs are certainly a great way to stimulate reflection and share ideas, and one blog I will certainly keep an eye on is <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Creating Passionate Users</a>. The reading of this blog was actually what motivated me to write this post, and although there are still many interesting posts I have to catch up, I&#8217;d suggest reading the article <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/01/crash_course_in.html" target="_blank">Crash course in learning theory</a> as a starting point in this great blog.

So, what can you do if you&#8217;re stuck on Windows and want to use Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/" target="_blank">Dashboard</a> Widgets? You can go to <a href="http://www.widgetop.com/" target="_blank">Widgetop</a> - a site that imitates Mac OS X widgets in your browsers (the site supposedly works best with <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>). The whole thing isn&#8217;t as pretty as the real thing of course, but if you want pretty you stick to Mac OS X ;)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/apple-dashboard-widgets-on-windows.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/apple-dashboard-widgets-on-windows.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

<div style="text-align: left;">Ah, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/" target="_blank">Dashboard</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/" target="_blank">Widgets</a> are certainly one of my favorite features of Mac OS X.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
This summer the servers of our faculty got a nice present - a new virtual classroom that is now supported with version 1.6.2 of our beloved LMS <a href="http://moodle.org/" target="”_blank”">Moodle</a>. The first great surprise with the new version was an improved translation (slovenian) of the whole system and of course the improvements in functionality. A new version also meant that instructions on how to use our faculty&#8217;s Moodle had to be revised - both for students and teachers. In this process we had to include the new translation (that is now more complete and accurate), but while I was checking for changes in the system I was also very happy to discover new features, among which I was most impressed by the <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=22" target="”_blank”">Database module</a>. The module enables users to create databases with different fields that can include text, images, other files, numbers, URLs etc.<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3847/2482/1600/database.png"><img style="margin: 5pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 212px; height: 169px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3847/2482/320/database.png" alt="Database module in action" border="0" /></a>We still have to test the Database module for teaching purposes (as a study activity), but what we were already able to do with this module is a database of open source free software that provides a good alternative to (sometimes better known) commercial software. Any registered user of our virtual classroom can also add his/her own favorite software to the list, and also post comments to the existing entries. Also, for this specific database I also created a custom template for displaying entries that looks really cool. I think this module provides teachers with great flexibility, and the only limitation when using this module is our imagination. Although it is a pity that there is yet no option for saving different database templates or the option of being able to choose from a given set of pre-made templates. For this reason I&#8217;m a bit afraid that teachers that aren&#8217;t that familiar with HTML will refuse using the database module, as it might seem to difficult to set (although it really isn&#8217;t).<br /><br />Seeing that we were is a creative mood when preparing the new virtual classroom for students, we also decided to offer our instructions for students in a wiki version (as a supplement to the classical PDF version). For this specific wiki (that runs on eWiki) users don&#8217;t have editing permission, as the <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=273" target="”_blank”">wiki module</a> wasn&#8217;t yet used in our virtual classroom, and most of our students aren&#8217;t familiar with the principles behind wikis and essential wiki markup. Of course, it is in our plan to try to change the situation by including lessons about wikis in different courses (like Business Informatics or E-business).<br /><br />So far we still have no user feedback about these activities (that are by the way available on the first page of our virtual classroom to registered users). We are keeping an eye on the viewing reports for these activities, but I hope we&#8217;ll be able to survey at least a few students about their opinions and experiences about the new ways of publishing information that hasn&#8217;t been used until now. In fact, despite the different possibilities of material delivery that Moodle provides, we have been mainly using PDF files for course materials. And though PDFs are great for printing, they do lack a bit of interactivity and flexibility that the modules like wiki, database or <a href="http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&amp;rid=324" target="”_blank”">glossary</a> can offer.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/using-moodle-database-and-wiki-modules.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/using-moodle-database-and-wiki-modules.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Until now I&#8217;ve worked as an online tutor in the course E-business, which is an elective course for the students at our faculty. The course is mostly delivered online, though there are also a five face-to-face meetings during the semester. In the course students learn about E-business and their project work involves the making of a business plan for an e-business company they think of in small group (4 to 6 students). At the end they also have to make a prototype of an e-business company&#8217;s website and present their ideas to fellow students in a final meeting.<br /><br />Now, when it comes to making a website, most students get afraid and convince themselves that making a web page is an extremely difficult task. The course teacher provides students with links to various resources on the HTML language and a link to Front Page Express. In theory it sounds pretty well, but in the two years I&#8217;ve been working with students on this course I&#8217;ve noticed that groups create websites according to two scenarios:<br /><ol style="text-align: left;" type="a"><li>One member of the group already has some knowledge of HTML, website design or even dynamic web programming knowledge. The already skilled member of the group makes the website for the group, while the rest limit their efforts to commenting the final products. The website usually looks good or even great - the experience of the author are clear. Everybody in the group gets marks that are assigned to the website.</li><li>There are no group members with prior knowledge of HTML and website design. In this case one or two brave souls decide to venture in the world of page making, the rest of the group usually cheers the brave members of the group. The result? Well, don&#8217;t we all remember our first websites? Hello world, lots of images (don&#8217;t forget the background image of course!), possibly a background midi sound, lots of happy colors and fonts (that are not necessarily related), and oh! don&#8217;t forget the frames! Yeah, usually the style is what I like to call &#8220;so 95&#8221; (meaning the year 1995 in which we all tried to make &#8220;pretty&#8221; personal websites). But of course - the effort of the authors is visible, and in most cases pretty good for a first website ever made.</li></ol>So, after the websites are made and proudly published on the web (groups that work under the b scenario usually use free host providers that even add ads to the site - oh yeah, the cherry on the top indeed!) and it&#8217;s time to grade the work, give the marks. And now comes the big dilemma - of course the sites from groups under a are much better, more eye friendly, but one can&#8217;t punish groups under b with a lower grade just because they had no expert on the group, right? And it isn&#8217;t really fair to give all groups the same grade just for the sake of the effort that was invested? Sites from groups under a ARE in fact better. This year we in a way solved the problem by making a list of fairly neutral criteria that mainly focused on the appearance and content of the sites and tried to leave aside the technical characteristics. But still: most of the sites made by newbies were not as visually appealing as sites made by those with some experience - after all, we all learn a lot from mistakes and clumsy first attempts. And so it was that some groups under b were not completely satisfied with the given grade as they thought their effort should be worth more. As the person in charge of the criteria and grading I of course didn&#8217;t feel right about the situation, and the teacher also agreed the system isn&#8217;t really far&#8230; The question is what can be done? Do our students really need to learn HTML and to make websites? How are they going to learn if they think it&#8217;s a task greater than them?<br /><br />After much thought the solution (hopefully a good one for the students) presented itself during the reflection on my personal usage of the web. I don&#8217;t have a personal website, but I have started my own blog. If I need an information one of my first stops is <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, and to keep track of the news I use RSS feeds (I admit - I am too lazy to check n sites a day and scroll through them; I prefer to rely on RSS because Safari lets me know of new entries and it takes fewer clicks to get to the news).<br /><br />Evolving these thought further, I realized that our students probably won&#8217;t ever have to make websites from scratch in either their professional or personal life. If they want to make a personal website they can use blogs; when their company needs a site they hire professionals to do it or use CMS products - and the employees mostly just to have fill in forms and frankly give a damn about HTML or any other web languages. And that is why I think that it is more important that we show our students the variety of CMS that they can use to publish content on the web. Even in <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> the students don&#8217;t need to know HTML to publish for example forum posts - they just fill in the text, if they want to make it pretty they use the WYSIWYG editor and click - their thoughts are published.<br /><br />Now finally, what is my solution for the E-business course? We need to show students how to use blogs, wikis and RSS feeds. And in case they do want to make their own website they can use for example <a href="http://pages.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Page Creator</a> or Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iweb/" target="_blank">iWeb</a> - and again, both solutions don&#8217;t require HTML knowledge. Just pick a template, fill in the content, add some pictures&#8230; click, click, click = done! I think the most important thing is to make students aware of the technologies, teach them about the principles of hypertext, maybe some basic HTML tags (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">italics</span> etc) and then let them use the CMS they most prefer. Also, by teaching about the available solutions they will be able to include them in the e-business plans their companies make - and if that happens I think we as educators have managed to give them something useful.<br /><br />This solution still has to be developed in terms of lessons plans and course materials, but hopefully we will be able to use it in the summer semester in this academic year. I sure hope I will be then able to write some positive reports about it :)<br /><br />(Btw - an interesting article I came across today: <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/xSP/article.php/3640486" target="_blank">Why Wikis Are Conquering The Enterprise</a>.)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-e-business-students-need-to-learn.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-e-business-students-need-to-learn.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
