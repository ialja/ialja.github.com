Confused? Yeah, I know how you feel. But I think that reading <a href="http://www.elearnmag.org/subpage.cfm?section=articles&article=29-1" target="_blank">this article</a> about E-learning 2.0 by <a href="http://www.downes.ca/" target="_blank">Stephen Downes</a> can help you to understand the meaning and practical application of these buzz words.<br /><br />For me E-learning 2.0 represents a real opportunity to finally shift the focus from the technology to the users and to make e-learning really a <span style="font-weight: bold;">learning</span> experience and not just a different form of study material delivery. Education does in my opinion need to move with the technology developments. Not only because we need to develop <a href="http://www.ncrel.org/engauge/skills/engauge21st.pdf" target="_blank">appropriate 21st century skills </a>to keep with up new technologies, but also because we need to learn how to involve <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf" target="_blank">digital native</a> generations in learning.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-is-e-learning-20.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-is-e-learning-20.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Huh? Can I hear you asking what is a WebQuest? Here are some formal answers:<br /><ul><li>for the impatient: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webquest" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li><li>for those that have a bit more time to spend and a bit more curiosity to feed here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tommarch.com/ozblog/" target="_blank">Tom March</a>&#8217;s article <a href="http://bestwebquests.com/what_webquests_are.asp" target="_blank">What WebQuests Are (Really)</a>.</li></ul><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/work.png"><img style="margin: 10pt 10pt 0px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/200/work.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>Now that we are familiar with the theory we can see that WebQuests promote an active way of learning through the transformation of various web resources and prior knowledge to a learning outcome that students relate to. WebQuests can use different types of tasks (for a classification of WebQuest tasks see <a href="http://webquest.sdsu.edu/taskonomy.html" target="_blank">A Taxonomy of Tasks</a>) to activate students and stimulate their learning and understanding of a subject.<br /><br />And where can an educator interested in taking his/her students on a WebQuest start? You can browse sites that provide list of WebQuests in different categories (like <a href="http://bestwebquests.com/" target="_blank">BestWebQuests.com</a>) or you can make up your own WebQuest. If you want to create your own unique WebQuest I suggest the reading of <a href="http://bestwebquests.com/tips/red_flags.asp" target="_blank">The 7 Red Flags: Warning Signs when Sifting WebQuests</a> (also by Tom March) that provide some examples that can help you distinguish between real WebQuests and quests that will mostly result in training your student&#8217;s thumb and index fingers (because of the continual stroking of Command+C and Command+V keys).<br /><br />Of course, our students aren&#8217;t the only people that should be taking WebQuests. WebQuests can be a great way of learning - even for educators. If you want to give it a try I suggest following the WebQuest: <a href="http://web-and-flow.com/members/tmarch/classactportal/webquest.htm" target="_blank">Leveraging the Latest in Learning Technologies</a> (guess by who? Yes, again Tom March). Through this quest you will try to answer the main question: &#8220;What&#8217;s up with these new technologies and are they any good for learning?&#8221; and I think it can be a great exercise to get a bit more familiar with all these new technologies and to think about how they can be used in practice.<br /><br />I hope these links will encourage some new WebQuests to take place and consequently some new knowledge to be learnt :) And don&#8217;t forget to share your experience with WebQuests with others in your favorite way!<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/lets-go-on-webquest.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/lets-go-on-webquest.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Coming from Poland there&#8217;s an new online game that imitates the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/default.htm" target="_blank">European Parliament</a>. In the game players from EU (and other) countries can discuss current issues, join political fractions, cast their votes and much more. You can read more about this game in <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/039-12151-296-10-43-906-20061025STO12150-2006-23-10-2006/default_en.htm" target="_blank">this article</a> or on the game site: <a href="http://www.bemep.eu/" target="_blank">http://www.bemep.eu/</a>. Supposedly there will also be e-learning lessons that will teach participants about EU politics, though non are currently available.<br /><br />As you can guess, I already signed up for the game and taken a look around. I am still looking for a fraction that promotes e-learning to join - or maybe I&#8217;ll just create my own e-learning/geek fraction ;) Jokes apart - I think the game is a great EU initiative that will hopefully help us to learn more about the mysterious EU politics and build a stronger EU identity.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/who-wants-to-be-member-of-european.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/who-wants-to-be-member-of-european.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

Today I came across the article <a href="http://eideneurolearningblog.blogspot.com/2005/03/brain-of-blogger.html" target="_blank">Brain of the Blogger</a> in which the author explains his hypothesis that blogging has beneficial affects on our brains and can help to develop critical and analytical thinking.<br /><br />Although I&#8217;ve been seriously blogging only for a short time, I can already agree with most of the ideas presented in the article. Keeping a blog makes you analyze what you read more deeply because whenever you see an interesting idea you feel the need to share it with others through your blog. And as publishing new posts is so easy that you don&#8217;t need to worry about the technology behind it, you can just focus your mind on how to best present this new ideas to the readers of your blog.<br /><br />Also, for me reading other people&#8217;s blogs is very stimulating not only because I pick up many new ideas and points of view, but also because you can see so many different forms of expression (both verbally and visually).<br /><br />And finally, I also think that blogs  bring back the fun to &#8220;surfing the web&#8221; that we had when first web sites appeared online in the 90ies. And it&#8217;s not just fun - from my personal experience following links between blogs can be a great learning experience - and I can only humbly hope that my blog can be part of a learning experience for its readers :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-can-blogging-help-our-brains.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-can-blogging-help-our-brains.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Since the first day I&#8217;ve found the work of an online tutor highly challenging and engaging. The biggest challenge for me is finding ways in which to direct and motivate students with their course activities, and getting to know individual needs and expectations of my students. At the end of the study year 2005/2006 I carried out a survey about student satisfaction with the work of their online tutor. In this post I&#8217;d like to present student opinions about my work, while a more detailed presentation of the survey will be included in my diploma (after I study some more advanced statistics ;) ).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">So, what did the students like most about my work?</span><br />(I picked some of the responses - the only change I made was the translation from Slovenian to English)<ul style="font-style: italic;"><li>An unobtrusive way of presenting information.</li><li>That the tutor participated whenever it was necessary and that she always helped us when we were stuck.</li><li>Kindness, immediate answers, professional attitude.</li><li>Objectivity.</li><li>The tutor&#8217;s interventions in our discussion were good and she guided us.</li><li>Encouraging words, quick response in case of problems, relaxed atmosphere.</li><li>That she always responded when she was asked to and when she sensed that we were going astray from out discussions or that she encouraged us when we despaired.</li><li>Actually, I got more than I expected.</li></ul>It is clear that students appreciate short response times, and a fair relationship. All this in my opinion helped them to get a sense of my constant presence and in a way make up for the physical and time separations among us. From my experience I can say that the trick of being a good online tutor is being with your students just when they need you most. Being online 24/7 is absolutely unnecessary - students don&#8217;t really notice your presence if they have no need for you; but they will notice your absence if you&#8217;re not with them in times of greatest needs (like approaching deadlines, first encounters with a new activities, major group conflicts etc). Also, it helps to give a sense of presence to occasionally write a few words of praise when the students are working well and on their own - just to let them know that you&#8217;re there and that you appreciate their work. For me the best compliment I got from my students was when a student asked me: &#8220;How many hours a day were you online? At least 8, right?&#8221; - when actually I was spending on average less then 1.5 hours a day in our virtual classroom. But of course - there were days when I was spending 3 whole hours just working with students online, and then there were days when I only spent half an hour in the virtual classroom.<br /><br />And here&#8217;s another trick - it&#8217;s better to log in the system a few times a day than to spend a certain amount of hours online once a day. The picture I made displays this concept. The red dots represent activities that require response, the rectangles (the color matches the color of the tutor) represent the time each tutor spends online - we can see that in the case of the Morning tutor (that is online online for X numbers in the mornings) the response time for certain activities is much longer than in the case of the Flexible tutor (that also works less because he responds to student needs).<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/1600/tutors.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/5516/4465/320/tutors.png" alt="" border="0" /></a>While I was tutoring the course, I checked for new posts AT LEAST 3 times a day - first thing in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening; and that is how I was able to quickly respond to all questions and all unexpected situations. And why is that so? Because one of the advantages of e-learning is the flexibility in time and space - students can freely choose when and where they will work from. Some do it when they get to the office in the morning, some do it in the afternoons, and some in late evening after they put their kids to bed. And if you as an online tutor want to be there for them you have to keep track of all these groups (luckily for me we don&#8217;t have students in different time zones or I&#8217;d probably be awoke by concern in the middle of the night to check the evening activities of american students and morning activities of asian students ;) ).<br /><br />Yes, being an online tutor (in my opinion) definitely isn&#8217;t a straight 8 hours work. In hours it may seem like you don&#8217;t too much, but you do have to work practically all day and even during weekends. Plus you have to predicts the needy situation that will require more of your attention, but in the end, for me, it&#8217;s a fun and exciting job as few others.<br /><br />And here are some of my favorite links related to the the subject of this post (alphabetically):<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clive Shepherd</span>: <a href="http://www.fastrak-consulting.co.uk/tactix/Features/perfect_etutor.htm" target="_blank">In search of the perfect e-tutor</a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LearnDirect</span>: <a href="http://www.learndirect-advice.co.uk/helpwithyourcareer/jobprofiles/profiles/profile1345/" target="_blank">Online tutor</a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Maggie McPherson and Miguel Baptista Nunes</span>: <a href="http://www.eurodl.org/materials/contrib/2004/Maggie_MsP.html" target="_blank">The Role of Tutors as an Integral Part of Online Learning Support</a></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scot Headley</span>: <a href="http://www.innovateonline.info/index.php?view=article&id=78&amp;action=article" target="_blank">Five Roles I Play in Online Courses</a></li></ul><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/tips-tricks-for-online-tutoring.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/11/tips-tricks-for-online-tutoring.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
