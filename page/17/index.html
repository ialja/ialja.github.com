Yesterday I came across an amazing video presentation of the concept of Web 2.0 created by   <a href="http://www.ksu.edu/sasw/anthro/wesch.htm" target="_blank">Michael Wesch</a>. It&#8217;s a short and concise presentation of some important concepts and ideas about Web 2.0 (or the Read/Write Web). I think this video can be a great starting point for a discussion or reflection on how modern technologies are affecting many important areas of our lives and why is Internet such a big thing nowadays.

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.videoconsolas.com.es/imagenes/nintendo-wii.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 5px 0px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 108px; height: 78px;" src="http://www.videoconsolas.com.es/imagenes/nintendo-wii.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Wiiii, a <a href="http://wii.com/" target="_blank">Wii</a> has finally made it to our living room! And after a few days of Wii Sports I can share my first impressions and reflections on how the Wii can be used in education. I know a lot has already been written, so for those of you who might not yet know what is a Wii I suggest reading <a href="http://silversprite.wordpress.com/2006/12/23/nintendo-wii-first-impressions/" target="_blank">Nintendo Wii: first impressions</a> - a great post that in my opinion nicely describes what a Wii is and how you can play with it. Also, you might want to read <a href="http://edu.blogs.com/edublogs/2007/01/a_wii_post_on_e.html" target="_blank">A Wii post on educational gaming</a>, just to warm up ;-)<br /><br />Ok, let me now describe my personal Wii experience. The first word that came to my mind after using Wii was: <span style="font-weight: bold;">intuitive</span>! The new motion-sensitive controllers are in my opinion amazing and playing the games feels so natural. You just use the controller as if it was a tennis racket or a baseball bat and that&#8217;s it. Before I got the Wii, I was a bit afraid that playing Wii Sports would soon get boring, but it just doesn&#8217;t. It feels like a real game and it is a totally engaging and addictive game (also, the muscle ache the day after was 100% real - I was never really ware of all the upper-body muscles you can train with playing those sports before I tried Wii Sports :-/).<br /><br />Apart from providing great physical exercise (by the way - you can quite easily loose some wight with the Wii - don&#8217;t take my word for it, read the <a href="http://wiinintendo.net/2007/01/15/wii-sports-experiment-results/" target="_blank">Wii Sports Experiment, Results!</a>), the Wii can also connect to the Internet and can be used to socialize with your Wii friends. You can in fact use a <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/devices/nintendo/" target="_blank">Wii version of the Opera browser</a>, check out the Wii news and weather channel, or use the Message Board to send and receive messages and keep track of your progress. The really fun thing is that each Wii player can build his/her own Mii - a virtual character that can be used in games or that you can let travel to your friends&#8217; Wiis (look at the picture below - it&#8217;s my Mii!). Isn&#8217;t that cute? ;-) But also, it&#8217;s a fun way to interact with your friends - you can in fact even save your Mii to your own Wii Mote (the Wii controller) and when you visit a friend, you can transfer your Mii to his/her Wii :-)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RcNBeXBSJwI/AAAAAAAAAB4/iAKfMS3KZmA/s1600-h/mii.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 271px; height: 210px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RcNBeXBSJwI/AAAAAAAAAB4/iAKfMS3KZmA/s320/mii.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5026933598906885890" border="0" /></a>The Miis are sure a cute feature, but as an Internet addict I must say that I enjoy the <span style="font-weight: bold;">web browser</span> much more. The Wii browser is still a Trial version and I think there is still a lot of room for improvement (like encoding settings - right now the browser can&#8217;t display certain specific characters of my language), but at a first glance it looks ok. You can zoom in or out on web pages, which is really useful because of the low resolution of TV screens. The browser has Flash support, and there are already web sites with flash games that can be easily played on the Wii (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=wii+flash+games" target="_blank">Google Wii flash games</a>). You can also watch YouTube or Google Videos with no problems. Browsing with the Wii Mote is over all very intuitive and easy to learn. When you need to type a web address or fill out a form you use an on-screen keyboard - you can&#8217;t type as fast as on a real keyboard, but you get some help in the form of word suggestions and I really like the fact that it provides a subtle tactile feedback (the remote vibrates slightly when you move over a letter).<br /><br />Now <span style="font-weight: bold;">a few weak points</span> I noticed so far. Firstly, a quite annoying problem with the keyboard interface: it isn&#8217;t good for editing fields with existing text - let&#8217;s say a wiki page or blog post - because it doesn&#8217;t show the content of the field, but just lets you type in new words. I hope that gets solved in future versions. And on the subject of the Wii Opera browser:  I came across the post <a href="http://operawatch.com/news/2007/01/using-the-wii-opera-browser-for-educational-purposes.html" target="_blank">Using the Wii Opera browser for educational purposes</a> today and I was really surprised to see that kids find playing flash games with the Wii Mote so engaging. Surely, flash games are only mini educational games (for more on the subject read Marc Prensky&#8217;s article <a href="http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky-Complexity_Matters.pdf" target="_blank">In Educational Games, Complexity Matters</a>), but I really think that the physical involvement that the Wii provides is an engaging form of not just playing games but also learning. Here I must point out that the Wii is a new player in the gaming industry and still has room for improvement and even more room for new games. I think that in a few years we could be seeing really interesting games that will know how to fully use the potential of Wii&#8217;s specific controllers and that will also provide great, engaging, and meaningful learning experiences.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/05/wii-opera.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 235px; height: 169px;" src="http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/05/wii-opera.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Moving on - why is there now RSS reader on the Wii? It has a great news channel, a browser, so why didn&#8217;t they include an RSS reader? I sure hope they&#8217;ll be adding it soon - either as part of the browser or as a separate channel.<br /><br />And at last - the interface design is quite simple, but I think it could be made even more simple (bear in mind that I am a Mac user and have quite high standards as far as the UI simplicity is concerned ;-) ). A more annoying thing is that switching between Wii applications is a bit slow. I know it&#8217;s a console, but from my perspective you have to wait a bit too much just to switch from the weather channel to the news channel for example. Waiting for a dozen of seconds is not such a problem when you&#8217;re waiting for a game that you&#8217;ll be playing for hours, but when you have to wait just to see the weather or check the mail&#8230; it is annoying. So I hope they&#8217;ll improve that somehow in the future as well.<br /><br />So - what&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold;">my final verdict</span>? I am totally impressed by the Wii - it&#8217;s fun and engaging, and I see a lot of potential in it, but for serious educational use I think we&#8217;ll have to wait for a year or two to get better games and to improve some of the features and of course add new ones. Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m going to my new gym - my living room and Wii Sports&#8217; fitness (I&#8217;ve got to get my fitness age down! I don&#8217;t even want to tell you the results I got yesterday! It&#8217;s really time for us geeks to get a move ;-) )<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/my-wii-experience.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/02/my-wii-experience.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve actually wanted to do for quite some time as I really feel that search skills are very important today. Sadly, search is in my opinion too often oversimplified. It might seem like an easy thing to do - you just type in a few words on Google and bam! here are the most important results - of course right on the first page (nobody bothers to go over the third page, right?). Luckily for us, search engines are quite smart, but I still think that people aren&#8217;t really aware of how search engines work and how search pages are ranked.<br /><br />Also, Google does make advanced search really easy - but how many people are aware of that function and know why it can be used? I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s so obvious - especially to people that aren&#8217;t interested in technology, but use computers and the Internet because they have to (either for their work or study).<br /><br />And writing  the right words in Google is just the first challenge - one must also be able to evaluate the quality of search results and especially the quality of single web sites. Can a certain site be trusted? We all know that publishing content to web is now easier than ever before, so how can we tell whom to trust? And then - how can web content be used for school projects, presentations and such? I&#8217;m afraid that some of our students still believe that web content is free to use and doesn&#8217;t need to be cited.<br /><br />If you&#8217;re also wondering about similar questions or facing similar issues, I recommend <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/TeachingLib/Guides/Internet/FindInfo.html" target="_blank">Finding Information on the Internet: A Tutorial</a> by <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/autobiography/jbarker/" target="_blank">Joe Barker</a> as a starting point. Of course, there are many other great resources out there, so don&#8217;t hesitate to use your search skills and find them ;-)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/search-skills.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/search-skills.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
The Time Magazine chose you, me and everybody else that is building the new global web community with collaboration on a scale never seen before the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html" target="_blank">person of the year 2006</a>; but I wonder how many of our teachers really fall into that category?<br /><br />The Internet offers many opportunities to collaborate and share knowledge, and I&#8217;m really happy that there are many teachers around the world that are embracing this technology not just for their their teaching, but also to connect with fellow educators worldwide. However, what makes me sad is the fact that there aren&#8217;t many teachers in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia" target="_blank">Slovenia</a> that are actively sharing their teaching knowledge and experiences on the web. The main way to share experiences and findings for our teachers still seem to be by attending conferences. Nothing wrong with that, but we&#8217;re in the 21st century and we have the tools to connect virtually without having to gather together in one physical place (although that still is a valuable experience!). But why aren&#8217;t we doing more?<br /><br />Lately, the number of Slovenian companies that offer &#8220;e-learning&#8221; solutions seems to be growing, but they mainly focus on providing e-learning materials and only a few of them include online teaching or tutoring as part of their solution. And there also doesn&#8217;t seem to be any online community for teachers in Slovenia! The fact that I know more about how e-learning is being dealt with in the USA than in my own country worries me. I know that many of our schools are playing with e-learning, but I can&#8217;t find much more about it on the web: no e-learning blogs, just web sites that are telling the world they are doing e-learning, but it&#8217;s practically impossible for an outsider to know how.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.nasvet.com/images/iskalniki_matkurja2.gif"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 165px; height: 125px;" src="http://www.nasvet.com/images/iskalniki_matkurja2.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a>We sensed that gap at our faculty, so we launched <a href="http://www.moodle.si/" target="_blank">Moodle.si</a> - an online community for <a href="http://www.moodle.org/" target="_blank">Moodle</a> users in Slovenia with the goal to bring people together and provide all of us with an opportunity to discuss current Moodle and e-learning issues in our native language (<a href="/2006/12/moodlesi-at-last.html">more about the project</a>). Now, a month after the opening, I can say that we managed to attract a decent number of users, but not many reactions. People signed up, took a look around - many of them returned again, but only a few actually posted anything. At this point we practically have no feedback about the site or the resources that were freely provided to all teachers. The only enthusiastic response came from a person that isn&#8217;t actually a professional teacher, but still uses Moodle to share his knowledge. Ouch. Well, perhaps it is too soon to speak, perhaps we did something wrong - we can&#8217;t know that because nobody wants to tell us! :-( But I do find it odd that our teachers don&#8217;t seem to be willing to share their experiences online. So why is that so?<br /><br />The main feeling I&#8217;ve got (and at this point I can only rely on my feelings as there is practical no verbal feedback) is that our teachers are afraid that someone might &#8220;steal their ideas&#8221; (that&#8217;s also a concern we got from some of our students when delivering online courses in Moodle - they were actually worried their classmates might steal some of their ideas!). And that&#8217;s also a concern I often heard (and actually still do sometimes) when I started this blog. I don&#8217;t know what that really means: Does it mean that we don&#8217;t think others are able to respect copyright? Does it mean that we go online just to collect ideas, but are reluctant to share our own for somebody else to collect? Does it mean that we don&#8217;t believe our ideas are good enough?<br /><br />I still can&#8217;t answer these questions. Maybe the true answer is hidden somewhere else. But, what I do believe is that even if somebody goes around &#8220;stealing&#8221; other&#8217;s ideas, he/she will have A LOT of trouble turning these ideas into real learning. It takes much more than just an idea to do learning. It takes people that <span style="font-style: italic;">know </span>what they are doing, are <span style="font-style: italic;">passionate</span> about what they are doing and know <span style="font-style: italic;">HOW</span> to really do it - not just in theory, but also in practice. And that&#8217;s the really, really hard part. In today&#8217;s digital world there are many opportunities for being really innovative, many resources on the same topic, and although it all seems so great, it usually stops when you&#8217;ve got to <span style="font-weight: bold;">do it</span>, not just dream about it. Just an example: we&#8217;ve all been dreaming about Minority-Report-style touch screens for years, but it takes a genius to really bring that technology to the market (compare what Apple <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFrEjFseccI" target="_blank">did</a> and what Synaptics <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/c.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.com.com%2F1606-12994_3-6150132.html%3Ftag%3Dne.video.6150150&t=1169027103" target="_blank">did</a> - same idea, same principle, but such a difference in the actual product!). Just reading about e-learning doesn&#8217;t make you an e-learning expert and it doesn&#8217;t prepare you for all the real challenges of e-learning you will have to face in real situations. But I do think that discussing your ideas, comparing notes, sharing failed or successful experiments etc. can help you to improve your strategies and consequently improve your practical work.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Ra31kn4p9XI/AAAAAAAAABg/JQFgwPJbhwA/s1600-h/click-learn-share.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 201px; height: 102px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/Ra31kn4p9XI/AAAAAAAAABg/JQFgwPJbhwA/s320/click-learn-share.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5020939169118680434" border="0" /></a>At least that&#8217;s what I believe. Maybe I&#8217;m still too young and too naive; I don&#8217;t know - I hope you can tell me. I sure hope that more and more teachers will decide to share their knowledge with others and in the process help to construct new knowledge that will make education better and more fun not just for the students, but also for the teachers. No, you don&#8217;t get any points or awards for doing that, but you can learn many, many valuable new things that are in fact priceless - both for you and for your students!<br /><br />And please feel free to post a comment or write me an e-mail if you&#8217;ve got any additional thoughts, ideas or suggestions regarding this topic :-)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-are-our-teachers-afraid-to-share.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-are-our-teachers-afraid-to-share.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

In the last years mobile phones have been getting new features and mainly they stopped there. We&#8217;d constantly get new features: the ability to play MP3s, video calls, improved browsers, better cameras etc. but little change to the UI or drastic hardware improvements. And &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone" target="_blank">smartphones</a>&#8221; with <a href="http://www.symbian.com/" target="_blank">Symbian</a> seemed such a good idea (wow, would you look at all of the features?) but the excitement would soon disappear after actually trying to use one in real life: these phones are frustratingly slow, practically useless if you want to make a quick call or quickly write a note, and also crash quite often. But manufacturers didn&#8217;t seem to care about that - the important thing was to come out with new features! Until&#8230; Apple entered the game and <span style="font-style: italic;">reinvented the phone.</span> And they didn&#8217;t just try to make a better mobile phone and follow the trends; they presented an innovative new product that focuses on usability! Usability is a key feature that has been neglected for a looong time by other mobile phone manufacturers. Apple iPhone just seems so&#8230; simple, yet powerful - just like the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html" target="_blank">iPods</a>. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can really see myself using it in real life, real time. And nobody really saw such iPhone coming. There were <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=macworld+keynote+2007+predictions" target="_blank">many predictions</a> for what was coming, but all included separate products - in general we were waiting for a better iPod with video, a mobile phone, some hoped for a tablet computer etc. - but what Apple did was to combine a set of features and devices into one brilliant product that is years ahread from what&#8217;s on the market right now. And it&#8217;s clear that they did it for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">users</span>.<br /><a name="e-learn"></a><br />Ok, so what&#8217;s all that got to do with e-learning? Well, I think that the situation in e-learning is in some way similar to the one in the mobile phones market that I&#8217;ve just described. We keep adding new technologies - oh! let&#8217;s do video conferences! let&#8217;s do podcasts! let&#8217;s move everything online! etc. - and often ignore what our <span style="font-weight: bold;">users</span> (students) really need. They won&#8217;t learn better just because we&#8217;ll present a topic with the super new technology - it might help, but it might frustrate learners if used in an improper way. We need to think outside the box, try to focus on the learners and be brave and innovative in ways that nobody can yet imagine! I don&#8217;t think the winning combination is just adding all the cool technologies that are coming around, but to combine what we have and invent something new in an unique way that will be fun, engaging, effective and that users can relate to. We should try to achieve iLearning (<span style="font-style: italic;">i </span>as intelligent, not just <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span> as internet) for the users and not for our own egos.<br /><br />And some educators are already doing that by focusing on the learning and not on the technology. And they do that by using technology just as a tool to achieve their goals. But unfortunately, too many people still believe that e-learning means backing up traditional &#8220;learning&#8221; (I prefer to call that passive transfer of facts) with e-technologies. Just yesterday our faculty received an e-mail from a company (let them remain unnamed) that is offering development of e-learning materials and online courses. I was of course curious to see how they do it and was absolutely shocked to see what it is that they are trying to sell. The first thing that shocked me in their presentation was that they advertised e-learning as a way to lower teaching costs and making teaching easier for the teachers. I definitely don&#8217;t think this is the case. E-learning can in fact be more expensive to prepare and it definitely is more demanding for the teachers (well, at least if we want to do it the iLearn way)! Which is definitely a good thing! E-learning shouldn&#8217;t be a tool for the lazy teacher, but should be used by teachers that care and want to engage students in learning in different ways. Then, the second thing that almost made me fall off my chair were the unnamed company&#8217;s sample &#8220;learning&#8221; materials. The materials were made in Flash and included a poor PowerPoint-like presentation with cheap graphics and a voice narration by somebody that didn&#8217;t really care about what was being said, and no way to pause or navigate through the whole thing. You just have to wait for the thing to play through (did I mention the at least 5 seconds long useless pauses between slides?). I of course gave up after a minute or two. And then I went on to check the sample &#8220;online course&#8221;, which basically consisted of a series of &#8220;learning&#8221; materials (created in the manner I already described) that were indexed by chapters.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RaYblH4p9WI/AAAAAAAAABQ/8VbU3fC0xvI/s1600-h/ouch.png"><img style="margin: 10px auto; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 163px; height: 127px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RaYblH4p9WI/AAAAAAAAABQ/8VbU3fC0xvI/s200/ouch.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5018729159336785250" border="0" /></a><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);font-size:78%;" ><span style="font-style: italic;">Artwork by <a href="http://en.isd-group.com/about/" target="_blank">ISD Group</a>. More info <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/MartinHardee/entry/design_comics_templates_1_0" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></span><br /></div><br />Had the thing been done by 4th graders, perhaps it could be said the materials were cute, but this was created by a group (not a small one mind you!) of adult &#8220;professionals&#8221; and they are trying to SELL this as e-learning! That made me a bit angry and also sad because of the thought that some school/faculty might actually buy it because they want to try out the oh-so-popular e-learning.<br /><br />I know that what we&#8217;re trying to do at our faculty is just a little piece of e-learning, but at least we&#8217;re trying hard to find new ways (and the focus is on new ways, not new technologies) in e-learning that will not be just a way to advertise how cool we are, but that will actually be relevant to our students. And after seeing that awful example of &#8220;e-learning&#8221; yesterday I realized that we must try even harder to get closer to iLearning and we must also spread the word about what e-learning really is. Or perhaps we should start using another word for e-learning that isn&#8217;t just about passive transfer of facts through electronic channels, but that is is about the <span style="font-weight: bold;">learners</span>. Yes, perhaps it isn&#8217;t such a bad idea to start using the word E-learning 2.0 (view <a href="/2006/11/what-is-e-learning-20.html">my previous post</a> on this).<br /><span class="down" style="display: block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link" onmouseover="ButtonHoverOn(this);" onmouseout="ButtonHoverOff(this);" onmouseup="" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);"></span><br />So, I really think that even in the field of (e)learning we can learn something from Apple products that are incredibly focused on its users and pay great attention to usability and tiny details that solve simple problems (example: the <a href="http://ant.sillydog.org/blog/2006/001356.php" target="_blank">MagSafe Power Adapter</a>). And I&#8217;d like to conclude this post by following Steve&#8217;s example and quoting great hockey player <a href="http://www.waynegretzky.com/" target="_blank">Wayne Gretzky</a>:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(70, 122, 167);font-size:100%;" >&#8220;I skate to where the puck in going to be, not where it has been.&#8221; </span><br /></div>In education there are still too many examples of skating to where the puck was in the previous game. Let&#8217;s all try to change that - bit by bit or with great innovative ideas.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/reinventing-e-learning.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/reinventing-e-learning.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

These days I&#8217;m busy revising and rewriting some study materials for our E-business course. In this year we&#8217;ll hopefully be adding a chapter dedicated to currently popular web tools and concepts. For this purpose I&#8217;ve written a quick guide to some Web 2.0 concepts and tools (although I think that the best way for our students to learn about Web 2.0 would be to let them create their own study material using collaboration and Web 2.0 tools).<br /><br />In this post I&#8217;m sharing a list* of web resources that were the most useful to <span style="font-style: italic;">me</span> while writing about these concepts.

Why the new Apple gadget (much more than just a mobile phone) is called iPhone still remains a mystery (didn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/12/18/cisco-not-apple-announces-iphone-branded-voip-phones/" target="_blank">Cisco</a> own that name?).<br /><br />Anyhow, the iPhone has a really revolutionary multi-touch screen that looks pretty simple and efficient (I can&#8217;t wait to get my fingers on one!) and it runs Mac OS X so it&#8217;s much much faster than current Symbian based &#8220;smartphones&#8221;. That is why I really think it&#8217;ll also be a great learning device (although the price will be quite high for some time). What else is there to say but: keep them coming Apple!
