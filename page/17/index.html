In the last years mobile phones have been getting new features and mainly they stopped there. We&#8217;d constantly get new features: the ability to play MP3s, video calls, improved browsers, better cameras etc. but little change to the UI or drastic hardware improvements. And &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone" target="_blank">smartphones</a>&#8221; with <a href="http://www.symbian.com/" target="_blank">Symbian</a> seemed such a good idea (wow, would you look at all of the features?) but the excitement would soon disappear after actually trying to use one in real life: these phones are frustratingly slow, practically useless if you want to make a quick call or quickly write a note, and also crash quite often. But manufacturers didn&#8217;t seem to care about that - the important thing was to come out with new features! Until&#8230; Apple entered the game and <span style="font-style: italic;">reinvented the phone.</span> And they didn&#8217;t just try to make a better mobile phone and follow the trends; they presented an innovative new product that focuses on usability! Usability is a key feature that has been neglected for a looong time by other mobile phone manufacturers. Apple iPhone just seems so&#8230; simple, yet powerful - just like the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html" target="_blank">iPods</a>. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can really see myself using it in real life, real time. And nobody really saw such iPhone coming. There were <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=macworld+keynote+2007+predictions" target="_blank">many predictions</a> for what was coming, but all included separate products - in general we were waiting for a better iPod with video, a mobile phone, some hoped for a tablet computer etc. - but what Apple did was to combine a set of features and devices into one brilliant product that is years ahread from what&#8217;s on the market right now. And it&#8217;s clear that they did it for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">users</span>.<br /><a name="e-learn"></a><br />Ok, so what&#8217;s all that got to do with e-learning? Well, I think that the situation in e-learning is in some way similar to the one in the mobile phones market that I&#8217;ve just described. We keep adding new technologies - oh! let&#8217;s do video conferences! let&#8217;s do podcasts! let&#8217;s move everything online! etc. - and often ignore what our <span style="font-weight: bold;">users</span> (students) really need. They won&#8217;t learn better just because we&#8217;ll present a topic with the super new technology - it might help, but it might frustrate learners if used in an improper way. We need to think outside the box, try to focus on the learners and be brave and innovative in ways that nobody can yet imagine! I don&#8217;t think the winning combination is just adding all the cool technologies that are coming around, but to combine what we have and invent something new in an unique way that will be fun, engaging, effective and that users can relate to. We should try to achieve iLearning (<span style="font-style: italic;">i </span>as intelligent, not just <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span> as internet) for the users and not for our own egos.<br /><br />And some educators are already doing that by focusing on the learning and not on the technology. And they do that by using technology just as a tool to achieve their goals. But unfortunately, too many people still believe that e-learning means backing up traditional &#8220;learning&#8221; (I prefer to call that passive transfer of facts) with e-technologies. Just yesterday our faculty received an e-mail from a company (let them remain unnamed) that is offering development of e-learning materials and online courses. I was of course curious to see how they do it and was absolutely shocked to see what it is that they are trying to sell. The first thing that shocked me in their presentation was that they advertised e-learning as a way to lower teaching costs and making teaching easier for the teachers. I definitely don&#8217;t think this is the case. E-learning can in fact be more expensive to prepare and it definitely is more demanding for the teachers (well, at least if we want to do it the iLearn way)! Which is definitely a good thing! E-learning shouldn&#8217;t be a tool for the lazy teacher, but should be used by teachers that care and want to engage students in learning in different ways. Then, the second thing that almost made me fall off my chair were the unnamed company&#8217;s sample &#8220;learning&#8221; materials. The materials were made in Flash and included a poor PowerPoint-like presentation with cheap graphics and a voice narration by somebody that didn&#8217;t really care about what was being said, and no way to pause or navigate through the whole thing. You just have to wait for the thing to play through (did I mention the at least 5 seconds long useless pauses between slides?). I of course gave up after a minute or two. And then I went on to check the sample &#8220;online course&#8221;, which basically consisted of a series of &#8220;learning&#8221; materials (created in the manner I already described) that were indexed by chapters.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RaYblH4p9WI/AAAAAAAAABQ/8VbU3fC0xvI/s1600-h/ouch.png"><img style="margin: 10px auto; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 163px; height: 127px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_2DSTcHBBvTM/RaYblH4p9WI/AAAAAAAAABQ/8VbU3fC0xvI/s200/ouch.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5018729159336785250" border="0" /></a><span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);font-size:78%;" ><span style="font-style: italic;">Artwork by <a href="http://en.isd-group.com/about/" target="_blank">ISD Group</a>. More info <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/MartinHardee/entry/design_comics_templates_1_0" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></span><br /></div><br />Had the thing been done by 4th graders, perhaps it could be said the materials were cute, but this was created by a group (not a small one mind you!) of adult &#8220;professionals&#8221; and they are trying to SELL this as e-learning! That made me a bit angry and also sad because of the thought that some school/faculty might actually buy it because they want to try out the oh-so-popular e-learning.<br /><br />I know that what we&#8217;re trying to do at our faculty is just a little piece of e-learning, but at least we&#8217;re trying hard to find new ways (and the focus is on new ways, not new technologies) in e-learning that will not be just a way to advertise how cool we are, but that will actually be relevant to our students. And after seeing that awful example of &#8220;e-learning&#8221; yesterday I realized that we must try even harder to get closer to iLearning and we must also spread the word about what e-learning really is. Or perhaps we should start using another word for e-learning that isn&#8217;t just about passive transfer of facts through electronic channels, but that is is about the <span style="font-weight: bold;">learners</span>. Yes, perhaps it isn&#8217;t such a bad idea to start using the word E-learning 2.0 (view <a href="/2006/11/what-is-e-learning-20.html">my previous post</a> on this).<br /><span class="down" style="display: block;" id="formatbar_CreateLink" title="Link" onmouseover="ButtonHoverOn(this);" onmouseout="ButtonHoverOff(this);" onmouseup="" onmousedown="CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton('richeditorframe', this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);"></span><br />So, I really think that even in the field of (e)learning we can learn something from Apple products that are incredibly focused on its users and pay great attention to usability and tiny details that solve simple problems (example: the <a href="http://ant.sillydog.org/blog/2006/001356.php" target="_blank">MagSafe Power Adapter</a>). And I&#8217;d like to conclude this post by following Steve&#8217;s example and quoting great hockey player <a href="http://www.waynegretzky.com/" target="_blank">Wayne Gretzky</a>:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(70, 122, 167);font-size:100%;" >&#8220;I skate to where the puck in going to be, not where it has been.&#8221; </span><br /></div>In education there are still too many examples of skating to where the puck was in the previous game. Let&#8217;s all try to change that - bit by bit or with great innovative ideas.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/reinventing-e-learning.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/reinventing-e-learning.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

These days I&#8217;m busy revising and rewriting some study materials for our E-business course. In this year we&#8217;ll hopefully be adding a chapter dedicated to currently popular web tools and concepts. For this purpose I&#8217;ve written a quick guide to some Web 2.0 concepts and tools (although I think that the best way for our students to learn about Web 2.0 would be to let them create their own study material using collaboration and Web 2.0 tools).<br /><br />In this post I&#8217;m sharing a list* of web resources that were the most useful to <span style="font-style: italic;">me</span> while writing about these concepts.

The start of a new year is always a time when we try to sort out the past and look forward to the future (if you dare, Google this: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=2007+predictions" target="_blank">2007 predictions</a>) and so I decided that it is entirely appropriate for my first post of 2007 to be in this spirit.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.globe-shop.com/prod_imgs/QuillPen.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 5pt 0px 0px; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 111px; height: 73px;" src="http://www.globe-shop.com/prod_imgs/QuillPen.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Today I came across this post: <a href="http://mlearning.edublogs.org/2007/01/03/progress-and-innovation-in-education/" target="_blank">Progress and Innovation in Education</a>, which presents some very interesting quotes made by educators that question the usefulness of certain innovations that we now of course take for granted. Reading these quotes in the year 2007 is certainly quite amusing, but anyone who has ever tried to introduce a new technology in education (or elsewhere) knows that attitudes towards innovation haven&#8217;t changed much from those of the year 1703. Surely, not all new innovations are useful, meaningful and meant to be adopted, but if we find something that works and that does the job better than ever before - why not? And here we must not forget (as history teaches us) that we can&#8217;t predict the failure of something just because we fail to see its use.<br /><br />But how can we fight against those skeptics that seem to be afraid of innovation and progress? One way is surely by showing them the now hilarious failed skeptical prediction (for more material check out the Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_predictions" target="_blank">Failed predictions</a> article) and by reminding them (and ourselves) that <a href="http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2960" target="_blank">change is inevitable and constant</a>. And I think the best way to adopt change is by trying out new things - sometimes you just can&#8217;t see the use of something until you try to use it in real life situations. So, my wish for our new year is that we&#8217;d all try many new exciting things and with any luck find at least a few innovations that will rock our world. And I of course also wish everyone good luck with spreading innovation - with some people such luck will always be needed :)<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">(By the way - if you want to know how to sharpen your own quill or prepare your ink check </span><a style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);" href="http://www.regia.org/quills.htm" target="_blank">this site</a><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> out :) )</span><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/good-luck-with-finding-and-spreading.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2007/01/good-luck-with-finding-and-spreading.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

And gadgets are no longer used just for fun; they are now an integral part of our everyday lives and are now increasingly present even in learning (which is something I even try to promote). And here I wonder - do we, as e-learning enthusiasts, give enough thought to health problems that new technologies might be causing? We all want to use the power of modern technology, but how often do we talk about its proper usage, the importance of taking breaks during work or proper sitting or typing positions? Are our students aware of these problems at all? Why aren&#8217;t we talking about this in our schools? And actually, I&#8217;m writing this post while wearing a wrist band because of the pains I got after a few days of intensive at least 8-hours long typing plus of course &#8220;leisure&#8221; browsing.<br /><br />So, what can we do about this &#8220;disease of modern times&#8221;? I think that as educators we should be talking about this with our students when discussing new technologies and letting them know about safe and healthy technology usage. And also we should take better care of ourselves and take regular short breaks from work if we have to work with computers for a longer period of time. The best way to fight something is as always to learn about the enemy, so here are some useful links about this topic:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.rsi-relief.com/rsi-articles/rsi-tips-and-tricks.html" target="_blank">RSI Tips, Tricks, &amp; Suggestions - RSI-Relief</a></li><li><a href="http://www.albionresearch.com/astopnow/rsi_prevention.php" target="_blank">10 Simple RSI Prevention Tips</a></li><li><a href="http://ergonomics.about.com/od/treatmentprevention/tp/prevwristrsi.htm" target="_blank">Top 10 Tips to Prevent Wrist Repetitive Stress Injuries</a></li><li><a href="http://www.micahworld.com/rsi/" target="_blank">Micah&#8217;s Tips for Preventing and Recovering from RSI</a></li></ul>&#8230; and of  course a lot more can be found on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?&q=rsi+prevention" target="_blank">Google</a>.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/painful-e-life.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/painful-e-life.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

What do I mean? Well, lately I&#8217;m just finding quite some opened windows/tabs and had no idea where they come from or why I opened them. How does this happen? The usual process: in the morning I open all the feeds that have new posts, right click - open in new tab on those that seem interesting, quickly read through them, click on a few links, and then if I&#8217;m still too sleepy I grab a cup of coffee that of course wakes me a bit, so I decide to minimize all opened browser windows and start doing something else - writing, researching, reading&#8230;. And an hour (or even more) later I remember those minimized windows and realize I still have some posts to read. Cool! I read the most interesting posts more carefully, and then&#8230; hm&#8230; why do I have this window opened? It was in one of the posts I read&#8230; but which one? The one I just closed? Hm&#8230; Yep. You can see my point. And this is really getting irritating. I know, I know, it&#8217;s all my fault, I should try to do one task at a time etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />But anyhow! I do think that our dear browsers could help us a bit in such situations. How? Well, I&#8217;d give anything (well, not my Mac ;) ) to be able to click on something that says &#8220;How did I get here?&#8221; and that could show me the link I clicked to get to the site I&#8217;m viewing right now. And I&#8217;m not really picky - put it in any menu you want, make it available with a right click, add a toolbar&#8230; anything! But I don&#8217;t want it as a separate program and I&#8217;m too lazy to re-open and search through my browser&#8217;s history. I just think that this would be a really useful browser feature for people that get lost between links like I sometimes do and that want that option available without having to go a certain site or turn on anything :) It would just be there, available when we need it. Some sort of log, but presented in a user friendly way with clear connections between sites.<br /><br />And you know what else would be really cool? If we had an easy, simple way to share the &#8220;How did I get here?&#8221; info. Why? Well, I think it could be used in education. Just imagine this situation: you give your students a task to do Internet research on Christmas trees. Your students of course go to a search engine of their choice, type in the keyword they think are the most appropriate, and then click on the search results they think are the most relevant. Of course, you can make your students write a written report on how they performed their search, but wouldn&#8217;t it be great if there was a simple (browser integrated) way to share and compare the browsing activity? And of course be able to produce readable and easy to understand report (they could even be visual, in form of sideshows for example).<br /><br />Of course there is also a commercial application of this function - I think many companies would be interested in seeing how we browse and especially how we get (or fail to get) to their sites. Here of course I think it should be up-to the users to decide if (and for how much ;) ) they want to share this info.<br /><br />So, this is my biggest feature wish for my dear browser. What features do you wish your browser would bring you in the next version? :)<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/dear-browser-i-wish.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2006/12/dear-browser-i-wish.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
