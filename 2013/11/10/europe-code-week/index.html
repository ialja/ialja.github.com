<div class="entry-content"><p>At this year&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/06/22/entering-the-digital-playing-field-as-one-european-team-da13/">Digital Assembly</a>, me and my fellow <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">Neelie Kroes&#8217; Young Advisors</a> were challenged to pick a common theme to work on. One suggestion was to focus on providing every young European with opportunities to start learning coding. Out of this suggestion, <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Europe Code Week</a> was born over summer.</p>

<p><a href="http://codeweek.eu"><img class="Europe Code Week" src="/images/uploads/codeu-logo.png"></a></p>

<p>The key idea is to have one week, November 25 - 30, dedicated to promoting coding all over Europe. By doing this, we hope to put existing initiatives like <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a>, <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojos</a> and more on the map, spread best practices and encourage more initiatives to be started. The initiative was officially announced three weeks ago by <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/25-30-november-europe-code-week">Neelie Kroes on her blog</a>.</p>

<h2>The amazing Coding Map of Europe</h2>

<p><a href="http://codeweek.eu/map"><img class="Coding Map of Europe" src="/images/uploads/code_map-20131108.jpg"></a></p>

<p>And I must say I&#8217;m completely blown away by the response! Especially by what&#8217;s going on in Croatia and Ireland, both countries where we have a teacher ambassador. Coincidence? Don&#8217;t think so!</p>

<p>In <a href="http://codeweek.eu/learn/croatia/">Croatia</a>, Ivana Ružić, an informatics teacher, managed to get over 800 students and teachers involved in 16 #codeEU events all over the country in a very short time. In Ireland, Young Advisor <a href="http://www.juliecullen.com">Julie Cullen</a>, rallied up the CoderDojo community and over 200 Irish organization and even managed to promote <a href="http://codeweek.eu/news/2013/11/02/europe-code-week-ireland-web-summit.html">Code Week at the Web Summit</a>, Europe&#8217;s biggest tech conference!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As usually, the media isn&#8217;t showing much interest despite the good news we&#8217;ve been getting from all over Europe. At the time of writing, we have <a href="http://codeweek.eu/news/2013/11/08/over-100-coding-opportunities-in-europe.html">over 100 initiatives</a> on the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/map/">Coding Map of Europe</a>. For some reason, a huge number of people volunteering their free time to help others learn new skills that will be essential for our future still isn&#8217;t headline worthy. I&#8217;m hoping this changes as the events themselves start to unfold.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s true, our little initiative isn&#8217;t as big as the <a href="http://code.org/hourofcode">Hour of Code</a> on the other side of the ocean. They&#8217;ve got the big names, the big sponsors. Which is great! But why can&#8217;t we do something similar here in Europe? Right now, Europe Code Week is just a very small group of volunteers, mostly Young Advisors. I hacked the website together over a weekend (it shows!), but we keep getting emails of support from all over the continent. I&#8217;m especially happy when we receive emails from people, who are considering starting something new because of Code Week.</p>

<h2>Europe Code Week in Slovenia</h2>

<p>One of the first emails was actually from my own country. <a href="http://www.mozilla.si">Mozilla Space</a> in Novo mesto, Slovenia, immediately embraced the initiative and they&#8217;ll be hosting their first <a href="https://webmaker.org/en">Mozilla Webmaker</a> workshop during Code Week. The goal of the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/05/22/introducing-mozilla-webmaker/">Webmaker project</a> is to help millions of people move from just <em>using</em> the web to <em>making</em> the web. I was delighted to hear they had to expand the capacity of the workshop due to high demand.</p>

<iframe width="" height="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lqMzBoiRr30 " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>This supports my own experience with organizing <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html/">Rails Girls workshops in Slovenia</a>. There is in fact an insane amount of demand for digital skills! And while it&#8217;s never been easier to learn through websites like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> and the rest, it&#8217;s much easier, faster and enjoyable to learn in good company among peers.</p>

<p>At the moment, I don&#8217;t have the resources to organize another Rails Girls due to everything that is happening with Europe Code Week and an intense startup job on top of it. But I&#8217;ve been part of <a href="https://github.com/codecatz/">CodeCatz</a>, a small study group for women who want to learn more about programming, since summer. It&#8217;s a weekly commitment and so far we&#8217;ve learned the basics of <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">Python</a>, started sharing code with <a href="http://try.github.io/">GitHub</a>, made our first web apps with <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask</a>, explored the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">holy trinity of the web</a> (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), and are now moving onto <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/">Django</a> with the aim of building an actual project as a team.</p>

<p>Eventually, we&#8217;ll do a &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; review and see how we can grow the movement from a small room hosted each Wednesday by <a href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> onto other chapters and forward. For Europe Code Week, we&#8217;ve invited a couple of high school students who are learning about entrepreneurship with the help of <a href="http://www.ustvarjalnik.org">Ustvarjalnik</a> to join us. They&#8217;ll pitch their business ideas, and we&#8217;ll teach them how to use technology to turn those ideas into reality. I bet it&#8217;s going to be a fun evening!</p>

<p>This week I also attended my first CoderDojo as a coach. It was great helping kids build their first game. I still remember the few programming lessons I took as a kid. Learning to move the turtle across the screen in <a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/turtle.html">Logo</a>. I didn&#8217;t take many of these lessons and didn&#8217;t grow up to be a programmer, but it certainly helped me to understand computers better and not to be afraid of technology.</p>

<h2>Why learn coding right now?</h2>

<p>And now, more than 20 years after my Logo lessons, I&#8217;m finding myself coding again. I don&#8217;t work as a developer, probably never will. But with every bit of technology I learn to understand, I get better at my own job, which usually involves a lot of writing in human readable languages.</p>

<p>By understanding technology, I can build a bridge between user requirements and the technical implementation. When I have to write texts for an app or test the user experience, I can now build my own prototype. It&#8217;s not pretty or usable in production, but it works and helps me do my job better before anyone else has to write a single line of code. Not to mention I&#8217;m also getting better at automating tedious tasks and extracting data when I need it.</p>

<p>What this means is that I don&#8217;t expect everyone to become a programmer. But our lives and work are increasingly connected with technology. If you&#8217;re a writer, you can use your skills to make apps more human. If you&#8217;re a researcher, you need to know how to extract and manage data from various sources. By understanding technology, you can help shape its future.</p>

<p>That is why we should get the whole Europe coding. Technology startups are our future. But we can&#8217;t grow without more talent on the market. Not just programmers, but people who understand technology and use it to be better at whatever it is they do.</p>

<h2>Now is the time to act!</h2>

<p>So, if you can code, at any level, why don&#8217;t you share what you know with somebody around you? As we like to say, two is a group already! And if you&#8217;ve never done any coding, today is the day to start learning. No matter where you&#8217;re coming from, the important thing is to start.</p>

<p>There are two weeks left until <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Europe Code Week</a>. We still need help to fill in the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/map/">Coding Map of Europe</a> and spread the word about all the amazing initiatives and events. Will you help us?</p>
