    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed that I'm getting increasingly fed up with the lack of women in IT. It's a fun, exciting, creative and increasingly influential industry, so why does the majority of my half of the population still feel like they don't belong in this world?</p>

<p>Well, I've found some good answers to this question this week. And I've got some tips for those who wonder why women aren't applying to their super awesome coding workshops.</p>

<h2>Monday starts with a great message</h2>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/women-and-work/1023a2e973dd">I need terrible female engineers</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/amyngyn">Amy Nguyen</a> is such a brilliant blog post you should just leave my blog and read it now. This excerpt highlights the key point (emphasize mine):</p>

<blockquote><p>"I don’t want to combat misogyny by showing people who hate women that there is absolutely nothing to hate. That’s not how you garner acceptance for women — that’s how you put some women on a pedestal and put down anyone who isn’t perfect, who doesn’t want to be perfect. This trend of glorifying brilliant women is great for the short-term, but it’s not going to create lasting acceptance for all women. <strong>We don’t deserve to be in this industry because we’re all so incredibly exceptional and talented. We deserve equal treatment for no other reason than the fact that we are people.</strong>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Good stuff, Amy. In a world where women are always desperately trying to be perfect at everything, we need this message to be heard.</p>

<h2>By mid-week it's time for sexist job ads</h2>

<p>And then came <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattgemmell/9465578396/">this incredibly sexist</a> web dev hiring page by a company that doesn't deserve to be named. To paraphrase, boys are programers, while girls write beautiful and sexy code. Yes, being sexy is the ultimate life goal of any modern woman! I do wonder why we haven't yet seen <em>"10 ways for writing sexier code"</em> on the cover of Cosmo.</p>

<p>There's so much wrong with this job posting I don't even know where to begin. All I can say is: talking to intelligent women, you're doing it wrong. And give it a facepalm. No, actually make that a double facepalm.</p>

<p><img class="Double Facepalm" src="/images/uploads/double_facepalm.jpg"></p>

<h2>And Friday is boy's club day</h2>

<p>By the end of the same week, <a href="http://hekovnik.com">Hekovnik</a>, an otherwise awesome  local startup school, posts <a href="https://twitter.com/hekovnik/status/365762522160185345/photo/1">this #NSFW photo</a> on Twitter. No, I don't have an issue with nudity, I just can't see how this is the right context for it. And the guys are surprised when I label them a boy's club. But are also willing to talk about this over coffee. So there is still hope.</p>

<h2>Why aren't women applying to our workshops?</h2>

<p>And today, after this week filled with discussions about the representation and lack of women in tech, I see a fellow Rails Girl posting about Hekovnik's upcoming <a href="http://hekovnik.com/python-workshop/">Python workshop</a> on Facebook, inviting more women to apply, because they are not getting many women at these sorts of events. I wonder why? *smirk*</p>

<p><img class="Orly" src="/images/uploads/orly_cat.jpg"></p>

<p>No, it's not about that crazy summer pic specifically. I do love Hekovnik. They are doing a lot of great stuff for the local startup community. Great events, great people. Which is why I want to help you out, guys. It's great that you're doing a programming workshop. We need more of that. But if you do want more women involved, you have to learn how to talk in a different way. Not just in a way that appeals to white, young, straight, geek guys.</p>

<p>I read through the pitch for this Python workshop again today, and even though I've been <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">Learning Python the Hard Way</a> in the past few weeks with a group of wonderful <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/how-lego-dragon-helped-me-explain.html/">Rails Girls</a> veterans and have successfully completed a few <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> CS courses with Python, I felt overwhelmingly underqualified‎.</p>

<p>I do have the nagging suspicion though that the workshop actually isn't as scary as it sounds, so I've decided to rewrite it a more woman friendly way, or, as I prefer to view it, in a more human friendly way. You know, for people who aren't deeply embedded into the coding community, but do want to learn how to build stuff and are looking for starting points. Just in case you actually want to attract this kind of people. If you're addressing experienced programmers, just ignore me, ok?</p>

<h2>Weekend exercise: let's rewrite a coding workshop pitch!</h2>

<p>Ok, let's go through the pitch. Heading:</p>

<blockquote><p>Learn Python</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh cool, I've heard of Python, tried it on Codecademy/Udacity/somewhere, would love to take it to the next level!</p>

<blockquote><p>You know a thing or two about Python but now you’d like to become a professional coder? Even if you don’t know anything yet, keep on reading!</p></blockquote>

<p>That's confusing. I do know something about Python, but I'm not yet sure I want to be a professional coder. I just want to make stuff. And the second part invites me to read on even if I don't know anything? Hmmm. How about:</p>

<blockquote><p>You know a thing or two about Python but now you're ready for a bigger project. You'll learn everything you need in just a few weeks under the guidance of experienced programmers in a relaxed group setting.</p></blockquote>

<p>Clear goal, don't forget to emphasize the human factor. Otherwise I can just go pick up a book on Python. Your workshop is different because you have experts and other people to learn from.</p>

<p>Moving on:</p>

<blockquote><p>As it is stated in The Zen of Python, Python is a beautiful and simple programming language. That’s why we like it and we’d like you to become a master of it!</p></blockquote>

<p>Hm, ok. Beautiful and simple sounds great. But the whole mastery thing sounds a bit vague. How about:</p>

<blockquote><p>As it is stated in The Zen of Python, Python is a beautiful and simple programming language. You'll be able to build powerful web applications in no time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, focus on a clear goal.</p>

<p>And then comes my favorite part:</p>

<blockquote><p>Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used for many kinds of software development. It offers strong support for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries, and can be learned very fast.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can't quite figure out who the target audience is here. Programmers know about Python (and surely have an opinion about it already, heh). To beginners, this doesn't really mean much. We could just leave this piece out.</p>

<p>Moving on:</p>

<blockquote><p>In August we’ll organise a program with lectures, exercises and discussions where you will learn how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply Testing strategies and understand the rationale of these</li>
<li>Apply Concurrency and Parellism</li>
<li>Write GUI’s for event-driven systems</li>
<li>Explain the concepts of networking in Python</li>
<li>Use XML for Processing</li>
<li>Incorporate Persistence</li>
<li>Develop dynamic Python systems with DSL’s</li>
<li>Use Python extensions and test them</li>
<li>Use Django framework for dynamic web applications</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, that's where you lost me. This is clearly written for folks with extensive programming experience. And sounds like a boring college class with grades and all. Again, I'm still not sure what kind of people you're trying to attract. If it's not professional programmers, I'd suggest rephrasing that by emphasizing the end results without big, academic words that scare off beginners or self-taught programmers who aren't yet familiar with the lingo.</p>

<p>And then the final piece that tries to defined the target audience:</p>

<blockquote><p>The program is not designed for complete beginners to programming – at least some experience is assumed. But since the program will take place in August, you have some time to learn some basics – the internets are full of resources for beginners. When you will have some skills already, our mentors will help you become a professional!</p></blockquote>

<p>"Some experience". Like what? What concepts do I need to understand? What program/course would you recommend to prepare for the workshop? Be concrete, what kind of skills and experience are you looking for? Also, it doesn't hurt to promise <strong>friendly</strong> mentors to make the whole thing a bit less intimidating.</p>

<p>(By the way, the workshop is probably going to be awesome, so if you're in Ljubljana and want to learn Python the proper way, you should <a href="http://hekovnik.com/python-workshop-apply/">apply by Monday</a>.)</p>

<h2>Not all word choices are created equal</h2>

<p>You might think these are all just insignificant details. But there's pretty <a href="http://www.ere.net/2013/03/01/you-dont-know-it-but-women-see-gender-bias-in-your-job-postings/">solid research</a> that shows that wording can cause a significant gender bias in job postings, especially for engineering posts. In other words, women are systematically put off by the way most engineering jobs are advertised.</p>

<p>Typically, these include very dominant, competitive words, which makes us feel like we don't belong or don't have the right skills even when we do. I see it in myself, I see it in other women. We are rarely satisfied with our work, and are hesitant in using words like "best, perfect, superior". For most guys, that's just business as usual.</p>

<p>You want to hear another little secret? I believe the choice of words, the friendly accessible communication style is the main culprit for the incredible success and demand for <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls workshops</a>. The Rails Girls pitch creates such a positive response because it finally talks about coding as fun, creative, and something you can do with your best friend. The exact opposite of the image of the lonely geek coding away all nights in the basement of his parents' house to p0wn teh interwebs. Guess what? Most people aren't really into p0wning that much. But creating stuff is fun. Even if you just <code>print "Hello world"</code> in the Terminal for the first time.</p>

<p><img class="Rails Girls" src="/images/uploads/rails_girls_banner.png"></p>

<p>And we need more of that Rails Girls spirit. Coding tutorials that are written in a human friendly way. Not assuming everyone knows everything already. You can be technically correct and use friendly wording at the same time. Shocking, I know! Code is written for computers, but when we talk about code and want to get more people interested in coding, we need to treat people, men and women, as humans, not computers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>Another <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html">Rails Girls Ljubljana workshop</a> also meant another lecture on how the internet works and the basics of programming. The goal was to ease in the participants, this time mostly high school girls, into the practical workshop that consisted of creating a <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/">web app for collecting ideas in Rails</a>.&nbsp;I was pretty happy with the <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html#more">first version of the lecture</a> I did for our very <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html">first workshop</a> that used a cute story about <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>'s <a href="http://octodex.github.com/">Octocat</a>, who loves sushi, but doesn't eat fish.</p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" /></a></div><br />However, there were two majors issues we discovered by using the first version of the lecture at the workshop:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://tryruby.org/">TryRuby.org</a>, an otherwise super cute website,&nbsp;didn't behave well during our workshop. With about 75 laptops on the same network, the site was painfully slow at moments, making it difficult for girls to keep up. Also, the order in which concepts are introduced in the tutorial is difficult for beginners (arrays make a surprisingly early appearance, for instance).</li><li>Beginners were a bit confused during the practical part of the workshop about switching from Terminal and local files with code. The meaning of all those directories and files in their Rails project wasn't very clear.</li></ul><div>All that meant I had to roll up my sleeves again and create version 2.0 that includes a giant dragon!<br /><!-- more --></div><br /><h2>Explaining the basics of programming in 15 minutes</h2>The solution to the first problem was to scratch TryRuby.org from the program. Not saying TryRuby.org isn't useful, but it's not ideal when you have a larger group of people trying to keep up with you. Instead, I advised girls to go through the exercises at home, and introduced some basic concepts of programming in a different way.<br /><br />I decided to show participants how to use <i>irb</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell">Interactive Ruby Shell</a>) in Terminal and how to create Ruby files in Sublime Text and running them from a Terminal (<i>ruby file.rb)</i>. In this way, I also addressed the second problem, as I gradually introduced the tools they would be using during the workshop. With different irb and .rb examples, I quickly introduced some of the most basic concepts of programming languages: different types of objects (strings, integers), methods, variables, if statements. Really basic stuff.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7T4GcLzOyrk/UTzwtRarA3I/AAAAAAAAAv4/RQujf3cOuqs/s1600/big-scary-dragon-lego.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7T4GcLzOyrk/UTzwtRarA3I/AAAAAAAAAv4/RQujf3cOuqs/s1600/big-scary-dragon-lego.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I also decided to introduce a new metaphor for computer programs:<b> a big, scary dragon</b>, which is what code looks like to beginners. It's only upon closer inspection that you realize that the dragon is built with basic Lego blocks you get to know right at the beginning of any coding course. When learning code for the first time, you can't go straight into building a big dragon, of course; it might even seem like an impossible task! So you start practicing by making small houses, cars, until you get a hang of it or find a good coach or online tutorial that shares with you the dragon construction secrets.<br /><br />I know, the explanation wasn't perfect, and maybe it wasn't all clear to those with zero experience. I hope I was at least able to show them programming can be deconstructed into smaller, readable and easy to understand blocks.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0A5Xxw8BlxI/UTzxDuPqYgI/AAAAAAAAAwA/wdt84LDOaFc/s1600/rails-mvc-sushi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0A5Xxw8BlxI/UTzxDuPqYgI/AAAAAAAAAwA/wdt84LDOaFc/s1600/rails-mvc-sushi.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />And finally, I also added a slide about the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/codeinmotion/mvc-demystified-essence-of-ruby-on-rails">MVC architecture</a>&nbsp;that basically serves the purpose of explaining why there are so many different folders and files in a Rails project. I heard some coaches referring to the slide during their explanations, so I think it did its trick.<br /><br /><h2>Web and programming intro slides (English and Slovenian)</h2>I wrote in more detail about how I used the rest of the slides to explain the internet and web apps in <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html">my previous post</a>, so today I'm just going to share the updated slides again. The original lecture used Slovenian slides, but I also made an English translation.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>It can be surprisingly easy to not notice things because "that's just the way it is". I have to admit I used to feel that way about the lack of women in tech. Just as a lot of women in the industry, I quickly started to think of myself as on of the guys and not even notice that I'm consistently a part of a minority at most tech events. In some ways, I was lucky that my mom was a geek even before that was a fashionable word and that I grew up without ever knowing computers were boys’ toys.&nbsp;But once you do start paying attention, it's impossible to turn the other way.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RailsGirlsLjubljana" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4OKqKxKxZV0/UTm6bGHM6UI/AAAAAAAAAvo/7GSUhnkdTfc/s1600/734397_517868904919059_991205745_n.jpg" width="580" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Self-driving cars will be on our roads soon, so why is it that seeing a large group of girls in front of a computer science faculty is still an exception reserved for Rails Girls events?&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><!-- more --><h2>Once you notice the gap, it stings your eyes</h2>I first started paying attention a few years ago. Ok, I'm one of the few women in tech. But surely things are changing because it's getting easier to get involved in the field? I mean, it's not like you've got to be super geeky to have a computer in 2013, programming languages have actually become readable to mere mortals, and you can learn how to code online. Yeah, all right, I see more girls popping up at events, but not nearly enough. Andraž Tori  recently did a great <a href="http://andraz.wpengine.com/2013/02/women-in-computer-science/" title="http://andraz.wpengine.com/2013/02/women-in-computer-science/">analysis of women in computer science at University in Ljubljana</a> and the data doesn't really show any positive trends.<br /><br />Which is all why I agreed to do lecture at MobileCamp Ljubljana almost exactly two years ago: <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2011/03/android-for-girls-new-frontier.html" title="/2011/03/android-for-girls-new-frontier.html">Android for girls: a new frontier</a>. I was quite self-conscious about speaking about about the topic. But you know what? It actually got a lot of positive attention! I realized that a lot of guys, developers, in fact don't usually think about half of their potential customers and they welcomed my practical tips on how to make apps more women (aka human) friendly! Crazy, right?<br /><br /><h2>Why is it even important to get more women in tech?</h2>After that experience it was easier for me to do a couple of more lectures on the topic of women in IT and especially startups. And while I was preparing the lectures (you can browse the slides below), I discovered more and more research pointing to the fact that this is a real issue in most parts of the world! <b>Women are increasingly more interested in technology, from the consumer side, but they are not as actively involved in the creation of technology. </b>Which of course means that we have tons of gadgets and apps on the market that were clearly made by white, straight guys living in a tech bubble. Nothing wrong by being a white, straight guy, mind you, but that's not even a majority group in the world. So how can we get all other groups to join the fun?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15326515" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="512"> </iframe> </div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/what-about-the-other-half-of-your-customers" target="_blank" title="What about the other half of your customers?">What about the other half of your customers?</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15449092?startSlide=3" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="512"> </iframe> </div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/startup-women-startupday" target="_blank" title="Zakaj v startup svetu nikoli ni vrste pred ženskim straniščem?">Zakaj v startup svetu nikoli ni vrste pred ženskim straniščem?</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div></div><br /><h2>My suspicious were confirmed by reading applications for Rails Girls </h2>One thing I found I could do was to accept the challenge of organizing <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>, a programming workshop for girls. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. The demand blew our mind. Surpassed even the wildest expectations. And by reading through each and every one of the 586 applications for our first workshop, I did get further proof that this was a real issue.<br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>Girls, women of all ages are eager to learn about how the tools we use every day are made.</strong> Telling us about how their boyfriends, fathers, other men in their lives, dismiss their interest in technology with "You wouldn't understand." or "You wouldn't find that interesting." Women of all ages saying they always felt like programming was only for guys. Women embracing the opportunity to learn a technical subject in a safe environment where guys can’t accuse them of asking stupid questions. And so on and on.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-783NUjYE_fQ/UTm3TzayW-I/AAAAAAAAAu4/EyiIe92b6dQ/s640/RailsGirlsLjubljana-racunalnik-KatarinaJazbec.jpg" width="580" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Photo by Katarina Jazbec</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I already wrote about what a <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html" title="/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html">magical event our first Rails Girls workshop was</a>. Not just because of the girls’ enthusiasm, but also because of our wonderful coaches. Guys and girls, experienced programmers, most without teaching experience. All eager to do it again.<br /><br /><h2>Rails Girls Ljubljana strikes again, this time with high school girls</h2>And we did it again. This time with the help of the <a href="http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/">Faculty of Computer in Information Science</a> here in Ljubljana. As we were discussing a joint workshop, we realized we could do a workshop just before high school students in our country decide where to continue their education. And so <b>we specifically tried to promote the workshop among high school girls.</b> This time we got 135 applications, though only 50 girls were under the age of 19 (I'm sure we’d get way more applications if we hadn't specified the event was mainly for high schoolers).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.517860094919940.1073741825.466225130083437&type=3" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r_e76USRVQg/UTm4GEmWdAI/AAAAAAAAAvE/q1aqbZm31MM/s1600/6553_517433124962637_241234575_n.jpg" width="580" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>We accepted all high school girls who applied. And on March 2 had another great event. It was a bit different though. Some girls were more shy, one even gave up after a mere hour - we had no such case at our first workshop, where the average age was well above 30. But some of the girls were even more eager than last time. <strong>Three interesting stories stood out for me</strong>:<br /><ul><li>A group of girls was interested in seeing the server room at the faculty.<br /></li><li>Another group was discussing about making an app for rating boys at their school. That’s, by the way, how Facebook started #justsaying<br /></li><li>A group told their coach they weren’t interested in the design tutorial. Instead, they wanted their coach to show them how to make another app, so that they would be able to do it on their own at home again.<br /></li></ul>So, you still want to tell me girls find programming and technology boring? All they need is a positive experience, and their imagination starts working at full speed! I was also pleasantly surprised when a TV crew visited our event, saying they got at least three emails&nbsp;internally&nbsp;saying they should stop by. And while we didn't make it into prime time news, we had a slot in the Saturday evening news on the national TV network. If you understand Slovenian or don't mind just looking at the action, you <a href="http://tvslo.si/predvajaj/porocila-ob-22h/ava2.160117678/00:06:31/0:8:20/">can see the news here</a>.<br /><br /><h2>Lessons learned from Rails Girls</h2>To sum it all up, here are some of the lessons I have learned while getting more actively involved in promoting technology among women:<br /><ul><li><b>We need more events like Rails Girls.</b> Seeing a room full of girls coding should be no more strange than a room full of guys coding.<br /></li><li>We still need to figure out a follow up to Rails Girls. Advanced workshops, meetups, hackatons… I don't know yet. But it needs to become a regular thing, not just an occasional flash mob.<br /></li><li>Yes, you can learn to code online in many different ways. But it's still intimidating for a lot of beginners, especially women who still think technology isn't for them. The social aspect of learning and the ability to have a coach tailor the learning experience on the spot is very important for some! <br /></li><li>Related to the previous point, a relaxed and flexible environment facilitates learning. Small groups working at their own pace, coming up with new questions as they go. All girls did learn a lot at our workshops, but they didn’t necessarily all learn the same exact things.<br /></li><li>I really enjoyed working with the faculty on our second workshop. Their coaches had no problem embracing the Rails Girls organized chaos, and they also worked well with other coaches. And I think this can be a good model of academia and the private sector joining forces. It was great seeing coaches with different background sharing their knowledge and experiences with beginners. I'd like to see that happen more regularly, and not just with coding for women.</li></ul><div><br /></div><h2>Encourage women in your life to embrace technology </h2>And by the way, it is not a coincidence that I am writing this blog post on March 8, the International Women's Day. It's a day when my Facebook feed is filled with pictures of flower bouquets and kind words of appreciation. Thanks for noticing us for one day, but you know what? <strong>If we really want to help women succeed, we need to arm them with two key things: education and technology.</strong><br /><br />ICT is continuously transforming all areas of our lives, and we can't allow half of the population to fall behind, to stay on the spectator side. Girls, women, it's time to stand up, speak up, and embrace technology! Just because you have a womb, it doesn't mean you can't handle a computer. The <a href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/girls-go-geek-again/">first software programmers were women</a>, let's not forget that! And it's not about talking over the world, it's about equal opportunities and active participation in the shaping of a better future for all of us.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/girls-go-geek-again/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CozWAob3BNM/UTm5iuTrQiI/AAAAAAAAAvY/1uftGYgX2GQ/s400/eniac+girls.jpg" width="580" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eniac Girls started it ...&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Don't get me wrong, I don't want everyone becoming a programmer - I am not a programmer myself, yet I benefit immensely in everything I do by understanding how things work. There are a lot of cool things you can do with technology and soon we will have very few jobs that don't involve any digital skills. Will you be ready for that world?<br /><br />To finish on a positive note, I would like to point out that there are many wonderful initiatives around the world you can get involved in. <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>, <a href="http://girlgeekdinners.com/">Geek Girl Dinners</a>, <a href="http://www.ladygeek.com/" title="http://www.ladygeek.com">Lady Geek</a>, <a href="http://sheplusplus.stanford.edu/" title="http://sheplusplus.stanford.edu">She++</a>, just to mention a few. And in Europe we have a big partnership, <a href="http://women2020.org/" title="http://women2020.org">Women2020</a>, launching today at <a href="http://www.digitaleurope.org/" title="http://www.digitaleurope.org/">DIGITALEUROPE</a>, <i>"whose mission is to promote women’s contribution to achieving the Europe 2020 vision of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."</i> There will be many big scale events and discussions going on throughout the year, culminating in the release of Women2020 Action Plan in December.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://women2020.org/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="56" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1aET6FgYwEc/UTm4uj_gMiI/AAAAAAAAAvM/R_kT5XvMVko/s400/cropped-women202011.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Having just met many wonderful and enthusiastic women both from the European Comission and various big and small enterprises in <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/how-i-found-great-chocolate-in-brussels.html">Brussels</a>, I think this could be a big and important thing. But in the end, it will come to each and every one of us, women and men, to play our part and provide support for women entering the field. I certainly hope I will have a lot more to write about the subject this year. And not just about the issue, but mostly about the results of our efforts.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>

What happens when you fill 2 classrooms and 1 big conference room at <a href="http://en.telekom.si/">Telekom Slovenije</a> with over 70 girls of all ages, who want to build their own web app, and 30 coaches, experienced web developers? No, it's not a rhetorical question, it's a real challenge!<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vkCHcmWd2Bg/UM72ZDyLCyI/AAAAAAAAAos/mo_g7PzdImg/s1600/219146_482121458493804_716264997_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vkCHcmWd2Bg/UM72ZDyLCyI/AAAAAAAAAos/mo_g7PzdImg/s400/219146_482121458493804_716264997_o.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Over a hundred people at the first Rails Girls Ljubljana workshop! Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Sure, the girls are among the most enthusiastic out of the <a href="http://visual.ly/rails-girls-ljubljana-december-2012-english-version">586 that signed</a>&nbsp;up for <a href="http://railsgirls.com/ljubljana">Rails Girls Ljubljana</a>, a free two-day workshop. But most of them have no experience with programming whatsoever. And the coaches sure are all excited to help and hope to see more girls among their ranks, yet most of them have little or no experience with teaching, especially with teaching complete beginners. Even after more than a month of intensive planning, countless emails and meetings, I, as the main organizer, can't help but feel nervous on Friday, December 14, the first day of the first ever Rails Girls Ljubljana. Is anyone even going to show up?<br /><!-- more --><br />The doubts and worries dissipate once I see all those smiling faces. Once I see the coaches interacting with the girls. Patiently answering all questions, making sure <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/">everything is installed</a> successfully and ready to go for the workshop. You can feel the excitement and positive energy in the air!<br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">3,2,1... in gremooooo, punce! <a href="http://t.co/zIPk6WPi" title="http://twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/status/279636337550843905/photo/1">twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/…</a><br />— RailsGirls Ljubljana (@RailsGirls_LJ) <a data-datetime="2012-12-14T17:17:53+00:00" href="https://twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ/status/279636337550843905">December 14, 2012</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="http://blog.ialja.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><br />The next day, Saturday, December 15, I wake up an hour before the alarm goes off. My mind keeps running through the to-dos, making last minute plans. The nervousness has already been replaced by excitement. Fueled by the positive energy of the day before, I can't wait to welcome the participants in the morning. A lot of them arrive early, also eager to start and get the first dose of coffee.<br /><br />After breakfast we start by welcoming everybody, but I try to keep the intro short. I can't wait to hear our motivational talks by two great girl geeks. <a href="https://twitter.com/sparkica">Mateja</a> tells them about how programming will probably make them feel like Alice in Wonderland, but also highlights the thrill of programming, the joy of <i>creating</i> something on your own out of code. Dunja then takes over to remind us of the rich history of women in programming. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bEur79eYw4o/UM74edH3lDI/AAAAAAAAAo8/g2og-6GANgY/s1600/316607_482120485160568_1640987580_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bEur79eYw4o/UM74edH3lDI/AAAAAAAAAo8/g2og-6GANgY/s400/316607_482120485160568_1640987580_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Hana making sure our motivational talks get recorded!&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Both talks make a great introduction to the practical part of the day. I first explain how the internet works and what we'll be doing during the workshop using <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html">Octocat, sushi and sushi chefs</a>. The smiles on the girls' faces are a good sign, although I also see some traces of doubts "Will I really be able to do that?".<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmXneBGpD14/UM73Ycmo3rI/AAAAAAAAAo0/Njx-IX_4akI/s1600/68657_482120785160538_711443265_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="399" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmXneBGpD14/UM73Ycmo3rI/AAAAAAAAAo0/Njx-IX_4akI/s400/68657_482120785160538_711443265_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Explaining objects and methods with a lot of waving around :) Photo by: <a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a>&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We play with <a href="http://tryruby.org/">TryRuby.org</a> a bit and then learn how to Google everything with the <a href="http://blog.railsgirls.com/post/20405930015/bentobox-learn-the-language-of-technology">Bento Box exercise</a>. But that's just about enough theory, the girls want to get their own hands dirty with code! Without further ado, they form small groups of maximum three participants and start creating their <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/">idea app</a> with the help of their coach.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lPQz8L9YktE/UM74fCAYqDI/AAAAAAAAApA/CgIrPcxv_QQ/s1600/380677_482120988493851_1888856434_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="386" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lPQz8L9YktE/UM74fCAYqDI/AAAAAAAAApA/CgIrPcxv_QQ/s400/380677_482120988493851_1888856434_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Making sense of the technical mambo jumbo during the Bento Box exercise.&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is when the magic happens! There is no other way to describe it. I walk around and all the girls have their Terminal windows open and are building their first app. The coaches are also in the zone, explaining everything, even drawing some of the most abstract concepts on whiteboards.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HLHiffWKyQI/UM74hLRIoPI/AAAAAAAAApY/DZRp_9Bfd18/s1600/60892_482121105160506_1144614278_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HLHiffWKyQI/UM74hLRIoPI/AAAAAAAAApY/DZRp_9Bfd18/s400/60892_482121105160506_1144614278_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of the rooms, full of girls and coaches.&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>We have a hard time making everyone wrap up for lunch. I hear girls and coaches talking abut their apps while waiting in line. The girls seem especially eager to finish fast and get back to their code!<br /><br />Food obviously makes us all a bit sleepy, so we guide everyone outside for a good dose of fresh air, a quick stretch and we finally do our <a href="http://fridayhug.com/">#FridayHug</a> group shot. There are so many of us we hardly fit into a single frame!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FEIEhhwjspU/UM79gyXUDHI/AAAAAAAAAp4/YB-BSwnERss/s1600/8848_482121291827154_160897704_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="393" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FEIEhhwjspU/UM79gyXUDHI/AAAAAAAAAp4/YB-BSwnERss/s640/8848_482121291827154_160897704_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Building a wep app.&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>After the group shot the girls return straight to their laptops and continue working on their apps. It doesn't take long for some groups to reach the "What's Next?" part of the guide. Before the workshop is over, some have already added comments, ratings, deployed their app online with Heroku, some are playing with CSS or working on special assignments their coaches gave them. By 6 PM everyone has their own web app. We are all tired, but happy and excited. The girls, the coaches are all thanking me for a great experience as asking me: "When are we going to do this again?"<br /><br />"After I get some sleep," I smile. There is no other choice. <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> will happen again in Ljubljana, probably in other cities in Slovenia as well. Girls want to code, coaches (boys and girls!) are eager to help them out. We still don't know exactly how and when, but we have to do this again. For all those girls (over 500 of them) who couldn't be with us this time, for all those girls who haven't even heard of us yet or maybe who didn't dare to fill in the signup form.

We already have a support group on Facebook running, maybe we'll even organize regular informal meetups to check everyone's progress.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iEqZN2ZM4uk/UM74hzoMMZI/AAAAAAAAApk/TOTLuLyzKFw/s1600/74069_482121261827157_1147127405_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="386" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iEqZN2ZM4uk/UM74hzoMMZI/AAAAAAAAApk/TOTLuLyzKFw/s400/74069_482121261827157_1147127405_n.jpg" width="590" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lots of love and positive energy!&nbsp;Photo by:&nbsp;<a href="http://otrokvesolja.blogspot.com/">Katarina Jazbec</a></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Finally, I would like to thank everyone who made this event such a magic experience. <a href="http://www.alesspetic.si/">Aleš</a>, our digital champion and the leading force of <a href="http://www.tsstartup.si/">TSstartup</a> accelerator (where I currently work as a community manager), for offering me the challenge of organizing the event and supporting us along the way. <a href="https://twitter.com/alivea">Živa</a> for all your support and the super awesome <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> t-shirt, <a href="https://twitter.com/AjdaAzman">Ajda</a> for all your energy and help, <a href="https://twitter.com/tadejab">Tadeja</a> for the great texts and tweets, <a href="https://twitter.com/RokPiletic">Rok</a> for surprising us with handmade heart-shaped desserts, <a href="https://twitter.com/anjalazar">Anja</a> for hosting two thirds of the Croatian team.

<p>One of challenges of organizing <a href="http://railsgirls.com/ljubljana">Rails Girls Ljubljana</a> was coming up with short lectures that would prepare the girls, absolute beginners, to understand the basic terminology of the web and what they would be working on.</p>Sure, there are some existing presentations online about what programming is and where Rails fits in the whole story, but I thought beginners could benefit from something a bit more simple, funny and thus memorable. Which is why I borrowed <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>'s mascot <a href="http://octodex.github.com/">Octocat</a> and sent him off on a journey to find sushi without fish on the web. Wait, what?<br /><!-- more --><br />Have a look for yourself, here are the slides, both in English and Slovenian (the original I used for my lecture):<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15661527" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="512"> </iframe> <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/the-web-and-programming-an-introduction-simple-short-and-friendly" target="_blank" title="The web and programming: an introduction - Simple, short and friendly ">The web and programming: an introduction - Simple, short and friendly </a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15661515" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="512"> </iframe> <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/uvod-v-internet-in-programiranje-enostavno-kratko-in-prijazno" target="_blank" title="Uvod v internet in programiranje: Enostavno, kratko in prijazno">Uvod v internet in programiranje: Enostavno, kratko in prijazno</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div><br />In case you find the slides useful, the main tip for presenting with them is: don't explain everything on the slides, focus on the story. In the first part, where I introduce the client-server model of the web, I didn't explain the technical terms too much. I compared IP addresses to phone numbers servers have and DNS servers to a phonebook. I do think it's good for beginners to be eposed to these terms, but they don't really need to know in detail what they mean.<br /><br />When talking about GET requests, I didn't explain HTTP or the format of a request. A GET request is all they need to hear, and you can mention that sometimes the server doesn't find what you're looking for in which case you get and <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/60-really-cool-and-creative-error-404-pages/">Error 404 page</a>. But if the server does find the web page, it sends it in HTML to your browser. Knowing all the steps will make it easier for people tounderstand that there are many steps involved into the process and that fast loading pages can only happen if all part of the process work as they are supposed to.<br /><br />In the second part I explained the different between a static and a dynamic web page using Octocat, who doesn't quite want the usual sushi. I explained the concept of a web app with the sushi chef living on the server, ready to tailor the content (or looks) of the web pages to each user's needs and interests, just like Facebook. And once you have a sushi chef, it's easy to explain Ruby as the language you need to learn to make the chef (the web app) do what you want.<br /><br />Simple, short, friendly and apparently memorable: one of the participants was just asking me about Octocat and sushi on Twitter, so I guess a different approach did the trick!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" /></a></div><br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
