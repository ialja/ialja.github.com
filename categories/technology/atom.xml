    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s Sunday. I finally got the chance to sleep in a bit. In just a week, I was lucky to participate in three amazing events that were started up by three amazing tech/startup communities. It’s probably not something that will be heavily featured in the news, what with the game of political thrones going on and the weather going crazy on us. But at least I can dedicate a few lines on my blog to these wonderful little things that are happening all around us and might even end up being more significant for our future than the latest puppet occupying the throne.</p>

<p><img class="Rails Girls Slovenija - CodeCatz - Ustvarjalnik" src="/images/uploads/rgsi-codecatz-ustvarjalnik.jpg"></p>

<h2>1) Rails Girls are taking over Slovenia</h2>

<p>This amazing week started last Saturday. The 4th <a href="http://railsgirls.si">Rails Girls workshop in Slovenia</a> took place at the <a href="http://www.fri.uni-lj.si">Faculty of Computer Science in Ljubljana</a>. In total, we have received over a thousand applications for these workshops in Slovenia. An amazing figure considering how worried we were about finding 20 women to apply for the <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html">first workshop</a> we did in Ljubljana back in December 2012.</p>

<p><img class="Rails Girls Ljubljana, May 2014" src="/images/uploads/railsgirls-ljubljana-may2014.jpg"></p>

<p>Turns out, women do indeed want to learn more about technology. It is however still unbelievably challenging to get high school girls interested in Rails Girls workshops, despite all the good buzz we’ve been getting. We have no problems getting applications from students, who are already realizing how important digital skills are. But girls aged 17, 18 or 19 still need more convincing, and we haven’t yet found the magical formula for getting their interest.</p>

<p>On the plus side, I was once again humbled by how many coaches volunteered to help out at the workshop! We ended up turning people down, and didn’t even have to do a big search for coaches. In fact, we even tried not to promote the need for coaches too heavily, because the spots filled out so quickly. And I’m even more happy with the fact that this year, half of our coaches were women.</p>

<p>This year was also special for me because I finally ended up doing some coaching myself. I usually end up running around, making sure everyone’s got what they need, but with such a great team around, I was even able to jump into coaching for a while, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience. I now fully understand why <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/coach/">Rails Girls coaches</a> keep coming back and why the new coaches (a lot of CS students this year) said they wanted to do this again. It’s just incredible to see the spark in the girls’ eyes when they create something on their own.</p>

<h2>2) CodeCatz building Europe Code Week’s events website</h2>

<p>Sparks sometimes need a bit more attention to turn into full blown fires though. Which is why part of the Rails Girls Ljubljana team came together last summer and started <a href="https://twitter.com/codecatz">CodeCatz</a>, a coding club for women. We meet almost every Wednesday at <a href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> for at least 3 hours, eat a lot of chocolate, and learn about programming together. We started <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">Learning Python the Hard Way</a>, did the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/">Django tutorial</a>, and then realized we needed to tackle a real-world project together.</p>

<p><img class="CodeCatz coding" src="/images/uploads/codecatz-coding.jpg"></p>

<p>So we took upon the task of building the new events website for <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Europe Code Week</a>. The website is now live at <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu">http://events.codeweek.eu</a> and it’s exciting to see the first events already being submitted. To celebrate this big milestone, we even had a proper launch party this Friday at Hekovnik.</p>

<p>CodeCatz is still a small group, but I think we’ve started something important here. For one, we created a small little community that has already significantly increased the presence of female speakers at the recent <a href="http://webcamp.si/webcamp-spring-2014-wrap-up/">WebCamp in Ljubljana</a>. And next week, our doors will open for new Kittens, mostly girls who attended recent Rails Girls workshops. We can’t wait to meet the new girls and start working with them from the beginning. And we can’t wait to start building new exciting projects together. Maybe we’ll have another big launch party by this year’s Code Week in October?</p>

<h2>3) High school students are starting their own companies</h2>

<p>Finally, this tiresome, but inspiring week ended this Saturday. I was invited to talk about the importance of programming skills at the final event for high school students, who participated in <a href="http://www.ustvarjalnik.org">Ustvarjalnik’s</a> entrepreneurship clubs at high schools all over Slovenia. This year, they have spread out to 52 high schools and taught 1,200 young people about entrepreneurship, startups, thinking outside of the box, and about taking the future into your own hands, not waiting for jobs to fall out of the sky.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ustvarjalnik"><img class="Team Ustvarjalnik with the best high school startup teams" src="/images/uploads/ustvarjalnik.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Part of their final event was also a startup competition, and I was lucky enough to be one of the final judges. All the participating startups were formed by teams of high school students, but you wouldn’t really know it if you just came to listen to their pitches. I’ve been at many startup events, and these were some of the best pitches I’ve ever heard. Great stories, great performances, and great ideas.</p>

<p>When I think back on my own high school years, I don’t think I would have been able to stand like that on the stage and deliver such a great pitch. These youngsters have drive, and are willing to dedicate themselves to their ideas. They build really impressive prototypes, and the winner, <a href="http://www.wivu.us">WiVu</a>, even has a real app published in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wivu/id847340843?mt=8">App Store</a>! I’ve seen quite a lot “grown-up” startup teams giving up before release date.</p>

<h2>... it only takes a little spark</h2>

<p>Yeah, what a week. I didn’t get much sleep, I had to skip a few runs, but I was filled with hope. I was humbled, I felt proud of my friends and the communities we’ve been building by just getting out there and doing stuff. We improvise a lot, we volunteer a lot of our free time (time we often don’t even have), but we end up creating sparks.</p>

<p>And it’s wonderful to see these little sparks starting real fires. Not destructive fires, but fires that create welcoming light and warmth. The kind of light that attracts people, that makes people better. This is one key thing to keep in mind. We need to create more sparks, more opportunities for great ideas to flourish, for communities to be born. And it all starts with these silly little ideas or just a tweet.</p>

<p>Irish Minister Ciaran Cannon also wrote a great blog post this week on Neelie Kroes’ blog about how a <a href="https://twitter.com/KirkBer/statuses/389064066733731840">tweet</a> from Irish EU Code Week Ambassador <a href="http://www.juliecullen.com/">Julie Cullen</a> created a great movement in Ireland: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/blog/guest-blog-lasting-legacy-eu-code-week">Guest blog: the lasting legacy of EU Code Week</a>. Again, the word humbled comes to mind.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Europe Code Week: Why I want to see every European learn more about how technology works]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/11/10/europe-code-week/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-10T18:16:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ialja.com/2013/11/10/europe-code-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At this year's <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/06/22/entering-the-digital-playing-field-as-one-european-team-da13/">Digital Assembly</a>, me and my fellow <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">Neelie Kroes' Young Advisors</a> were challenged to pick a common theme to work on. One suggestion was to focus on providing every young European with opportunities to start learning coding. Out of this suggestion, <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Europe Code Week</a> was born over summer.</p>

<p><a href="http://codeweek.eu"><img class="Europe Code Week" src="/images/uploads/codeu-logo.png"></a></p>

<p>The key idea is to have one week, November 25 - 30, dedicated to promoting coding all over Europe. By doing this, we hope to put existing initiatives like <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a>, <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojos</a> and more on the map, spread best practices and encourage more initiatives to be started. The initiative was officially announced three weeks ago by <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/25-30-november-europe-code-week">Neelie Kroes on her blog</a>.</p>

<h2>The amazing Coding Map of Europe</h2>

<p><a href="http://codeweek.eu/map"><img class="Coding Map of Europe" src="/images/uploads/code_map-20131108.jpg"></a></p>

<p>And I must say I'm completely blown away by the response! Especially by what's going on in Croatia and Ireland, both countries where we have a teacher ambassador. Coincidence? Don't think so!</p>

<p>In <a href="http://codeweek.eu/learn/croatia/">Croatia</a>, Ivana Ružić, an informatics teacher, managed to get over 800 students and teachers involved in 16 #codeEU events all over the country in a very short time. In Ireland, Young Advisor <a href="http://www.juliecullen.com">Julie Cullen</a>, rallied up the CoderDojo community and over 200 Irish organization and even managed to promote <a href="http://codeweek.eu/news/2013/11/02/europe-code-week-ireland-web-summit.html">Code Week at the Web Summit</a>, Europe's biggest tech conference!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As usually, the media isn't showing much interest despite the good news we've been getting from all over Europe. At the time of writing, we have <a href="http://codeweek.eu/news/2013/11/08/over-100-coding-opportunities-in-europe.html">over 100 initiatives</a> on the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/map/">Coding Map of Europe</a>. For some reason, a huge number of people volunteering their free time to help others learn new skills that will be essential for our future still isn't headline worthy. I'm hoping this changes as the events themselves start to unfold.</p>

<p>Yes, it's true, our little initiative isn't as big as the <a href="http://code.org/hourofcode">Hour of Code</a> on the other side of the ocean. They've got the big names, the big sponsors. Which is great! But why can't we do something similar here in Europe? Right now, Europe Code Week is just a very small group of volunteers, mostly Young Advisors. I hacked the website together over a weekend (it shows!), but we keep getting emails of support from all over the continent. I'm especially happy when we receive emails from people, who are considering starting something new because of Code Week.</p>

<h2>Europe Code Week in Slovenia</h2>

<p>One of the first emails was actually from my own country. <a href="http://www.mozilla.si">Mozilla Space</a> in Novo mesto, Slovenia, immediately embraced the initiative and they'll be hosting their first <a href="https://webmaker.org/en">Mozilla Webmaker</a> workshop during Code Week. The goal of the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/05/22/introducing-mozilla-webmaker/">Webmaker project</a> is to help millions of people move from just <em>using</em> the web to <em>making</em> the web. I was delighted to hear they had to expand the capacity of the workshop due to high demand.</p>

<p><iframe width="" height="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lqMzBoiRr30 " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<p>This supports my own experience with organizing <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html/">Rails Girls workshops in Slovenia</a>. There is in fact an insane amount of demand for digital skills! And while it's never been easier to learn through websites like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> and the rest, it's much easier, faster and enjoyable to learn in good company among peers.</p>

<p>At the moment, I don't have the resources to organize another Rails Girls due to everything that is happening with Europe Code Week and an intense startup job on top of it. But I've been part of <a href="https://github.com/codecatz/">CodeCatz</a>, a small study group for women who want to learn more about programming, since summer. It's a weekly commitment and so far we've learned the basics of <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">Python</a>, started sharing code with <a href="http://try.github.io/">GitHub</a>, made our first web apps with <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask</a>, explored the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">holy trinity of the web</a> (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), and are now moving onto <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/">Django</a> with the aim of building an actual project as a team.</p>

<p>Eventually, we'll do a "lessons learned" review and see how we can grow the movement from a small room hosted each Wednesday by <a href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> onto other chapters and forward. For Europe Code Week, we've invited a couple of high school students who are learning about entrepreneurship with the help of <a href="http://www.ustvarjalnik.org">Ustvarjalnik</a> to join us. They'll pitch their business ideas, and we'll teach them how to use technology to turn those ideas into reality. I bet it's going to be a fun evening!</p>

<p>This week I also attended my first CoderDojo as a coach. It was great helping kids build their first game. I still remember the few programming lessons I took as a kid. Learning to move the turtle across the screen in <a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/turtle.html">Logo</a>. I didn't take many of these lessons and didn't grow up to be a programmer, but it certainly helped me to understand computers better and not to be afraid of technology.</p>

<h2>Why learn coding right now?</h2>

<p>And now, more than 20 years after my Logo lessons, I'm finding myself coding again. I don't work as a developer, probably never will. But with every bit of technology I learn to understand, I get better at my own job, which usually involves a lot of writing in human readable languages.</p>

<p>By understanding technology, I can build a bridge between user requirements and the technical implementation. When I have to write texts for an app or test the user experience, I can now build my own prototype. It's not pretty or usable in production, but it works and helps me do my job better before anyone else has to write a single line of code. Not to mention I'm also getting better at automating tedious tasks and extracting data when I need it.</p>

<p>What this means is that I don't expect everyone to become a programmer. But our lives and work are increasingly connected with technology. If you're a writer, you can use your skills to make apps more human. If you're a researcher, you need to know how to extract and manage data from various sources. By understanding technology, you can help shape its future.</p>

<p>That is why we should get the whole Europe coding. Technology startups are our future. But we can't grow without more talent on the market. Not just programmers, but people who understand technology and use it to be better at whatever it is they do.</p>

<h2>Now is the time to act!</h2>

<p>So, if you can code, at any level, why don't you share what you know with somebody around you? As we like to say, two is a group already! And if you've never done any coding, today is the day to start learning. No matter where you're coming from, the important thing is to start.</p>

<p>There are two weeks left until <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Europe Code Week</a>. We still need help to fill in the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/map/">Coding Map of Europe</a> and spread the word about all the amazing initiatives and events. Will you help us?</p>

    <link href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/26/im-in-love-with-markdown/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-26T11:25:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/26/im-in-love-with-markdown</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just want to go on the record for saying that I really, really love Markdown:</p>

<blockquote><p>"… a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)." - <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, it's a simple way of writing for the web that lets you focus on the content. Because it's plain text, it's also incredibly easy to carry across multiple devices and platform (even mobile ones) and it's much more future proof than  some proprietary software format.</p>

<p>In fact, it's so simple, you'll probably say: "Wait, there's all there is to it?" when you see an example of Markdown like the one below. Yep, it's that simple. And that's precisely why it's so brilliant!</p>

<pre><code># This is the main title

## And this is a level 2 heading

Look, some text! **Bold** text and a [link](http://ialja.com)

## Let's try another section

How about a list of item?

- Cats
- Dogs
- Frogs

And a horizontal line for the big finish.

* * *
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>The example from below will look like this on the web:</p>

<h1>This is the main title</h1>

<h2>And this is a level 2 heading</h2>

<p>Look, some text! <strong>Bold</strong> text and a <a href="http://ialja.com">link</a></p>

<h2>Let's try another section</h2>

<p>How about a list of item?</p>

<ul>
<li>Cats</li>
<li>Dogs</li>
<li>Frogs</li>
</ul>


<p>And a horizontal line for the big finish.</p>

<hr />

<h2>iA Writer got me hooked on Markdown</h2>

<p>In fact, it's so deceivingly simple, you might not even notice that you need Markdown at all. When I first saw screenshots of <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/">iA Writer</a>, I thought it looked awkward and unnecessary. Why would I want to look at a boring screen with the same big font all day, no option to add colors and other fancy stuff? Because it helps me write faster and better, that's why. But you can't really see it until you give it a proper try and actually get some work done.</p>

<p>Yesterday I came across a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/23/markdown-book">recommendation</a> for an <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">e-book on Markdown</a> on <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, John Gruber's blog. Because Gruber just happens to be the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">father of Markdown</a> and because I'm spending more and more time in iA Writer, my Markdown editor of choice, I couldn't resist tapping on that buy button in my iBooks store.</p>

<p><img class="The MacSparky Markdown Field Guide on iPad" src="/images/uploads/markdown-ebook.jpg"></p>

<h2>The ultimate Markdown guide and Marked, my new best friend</h2>

<p><a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">The MacSparky Markdown Field Guide</a> is indeed a wonderful ebook that will guide you through the important aspects with easy to follow screencasts. It should work well for both beginners and those of us who want to take our basic Markdowning (not sure that's a word) skills to the next level. I certainly did learn a couple of new tricks, and iA Writer got a new best friend: <a href="http://markedapp.com">Marked</a>.</p>

<p>Marked is not an editor, but a preview app for all sorts of advanced Markdown such as reference-style links   that iA Writer doesn't support on its own. With one <a href="http://support.iawriter.com/help/kb/general-questions/how-can-i-preview-markdown">simple script</a> you can send the document you're working on in iA Writer to Marked and look at the fancy preview side by side when you're proofreading.</p>

<p><img class="iA Writer and Marked side by side" src="/images/uploads/iawriter-marked-post.png"></p>

<p>Not to mention that Marked also supports link verification, provides a handy table of contents for quickly jumping to different sections, supports custom CSS files that modify the look of the preview window, and tons of different export formats that will use your custom CSS. Totally in love.</p>

<p>What can I say about Markdown that hasn't been said before? Yes, it has made me a better writer. I am more focused on the writing, I spend less time fiddling with unnecessary design settings that are relevant for print, but not for the web. I create blog posts faster. Which is why I was so excited when I found out <a href="/2013/03/22/goodbye-blogger-hello-octopress/">a way</a> to base my personal blog entirely on Markdown files.</p>

<h2>Why you should also learn Markdown</h2>

<p>So, if you're doing any sort of writing for the web and haven't yet explored Markdown, you should fix this immediately. And even if you're doing more traditional writing, Markdown could be a great way to keep you from getting distracted. You could start with these links:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://designshack.net/articles/html/mastering-markdown-30-resources-apps-and-tutorials-to-get-you-started/">Mastering Markdown: 30 Resources, Apps and Tutorials to Get You Started</a></li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Daring Fireball: Markdown Syntax Documentation</a></li>
</ul>


<p>But if you really want an easy and step by step guide, <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">The MacSparky Markdown Field Guide</a> is definitely the way to go.</p>

Now here's a question for you: how long before Google decides all blogging should be done on Google+? Ridiculous question? I don't know. I don't feel like taking chances with Google anymore. But what are the alternatives?</p>

<p><img src="/images/uploads/blogger-to-octopress.png"></p>

<h2>When WordPress feels like an overkill</h2>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> was an obvious answer. I love WordPress. It's really powerful and it's what we use over at <a href="http://tehnik.mobitel.si">Mobitel Tehnik</a>. But is it really what my small blog, where I probably know most readers by name, needs?</p>

<p>Not to mention that "WordPress" isn't such a clear answer. You can decide to <a href="http://wordpress.org">self-host WordPress</a>, which is something I'm way too lazy to do. I don't want to deal with databases, with updates (I'm way too likely to click "Remind me later") and all that stuff.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://wordpress.com">free wordpress.com</a> blog wasn't a good answer either as I wanted to use a custom domain and have some customization options. After all, what's the point of WordPress if you can't have your own plugins?</p>

<p>That leaves paying someone else to do all the work of hosting and maintaining WordPress for me. While I fully support paying people for their trouble, I was again wondering if this little blog of mine is worth it. On bad years, I barely write more than 10 posts total! And I don't really need things like scheduling and countless categories and tags...</p>

<h2>Here come GitHub Pages and Octopress!</h2>

<p>And while I was pondering the big questions of life and my future blog hosting needs, I stumbled upon <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which defines itself as a "blogging framework for hackers". I don't really define myself as a hacker, but the proposition was tempting: Octopress is an easier way to set up <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, "the blog aware static site generator powering <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>". I started playing with GitHub Pages recently and immediately fell in love with how easy and fast is to host static HTML files there.</p>

<p>So, Octopress is free, can be hosted on GitHub Pages, is super fast because it's all static in the end, it's totally customizable, and even has plugins? Sounds good, let's give it a try!</p>

<p>Thanks to my recent <a href="/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html">Rails Girls adventures</a>, my MacBook Pro was already equipped with Ruby and Git, which made the Octopress really easy to <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">setup</a>. <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/">Deploying</a> the blog was also relatively easy with GitHub Pages, and before I knew it, I already had my new subdomain blog.ialja.com pointing to my Octopress blog.</p>

<h2>The challenges and joys of having a geeky blog</h2>

<p>I'm not saying this is something I recommend to everyone. I'm still finding my way around the command-line, as it hasn't really been part of my usual workflow until now. But that's precisely the point for me. <strong>I'm teaching myself something new</strong> and I don't ever remember having so much fun (and little frustrations) while setting up a blog!</p>

<p>The tricky part was moving my posts to Blogger from Octopress. Why did I want that, why not just start fresh? Because I wanted a relatively future proof backup that I can control. It's not just on GitHub for everyone to explore, it's also on my hard drive in nicely organized files. I even got the chance to clean up the mess that was my Blogger tags; I now use only 4 basic categories, everything else will be found with search.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find out that getting the content out from Blogger was pretty easy - hit Export and you get one big XML file. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581">import script for Octopress</a> was also easy to use once I got all the gems properly installed. Sure, the gems part got a bit tricky, but not impossible thanks to my new favorite website <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>And then I started playing with the import script. For that I had to pretend to speak Ruby (again, Stack Overflow plus the Ruby Documentation to the rescue). There are two main things I added to the script:
- custom permalinks for imported blog posts that mirror those on the original Blogger blog and
- information about where the blog post was originally published that I added at the end of each blog post.</p>

<p>Because I'm too lazy to go through every post to make sure it looks ok, I decided to keep the old Blogger blog alive as a reference. I don't really have any meaningful SEO to obsess about, so I decided not to worry about redirects, I'll just add a simple disclaimer about the new location on the old blog.</p>

<p>I held my breath while I committed the update with imported Blogger posts, but everything seems to be working just fine. The final piece of the puzzle was migrating Disqus comments, which couldn't be easier. Thanks to my foresight of perfectly mapping the links of old Blogger posts to new ones on Octopress, it literally took a few clicks for Disqus to take care of everything. Pure magic!</p>

<h2>A happy ending? Maybe.</h2>

<p>And so, here we are now. I am writing this blog post in Markdown in my beloved iA Writer, where all my blog drafts are made anyway. And when I'll be happy with the text, I'll fire up my Terminal, rake deploy, git commit and all that stuff, and you'll be served this page from GitHub pages. Totally geeky. And for the record, I just want to say that I love the internet and all the good folks that wrote all the wonderful open source software that made this moment possible for me.</p>

<p>If you've got any questions about the transition, let me know. Otherwise I hope you'll enjoy the new place as much as I do. I know it isn't very pretty yet. I still have to start poking around the design drawer, so I promise it will also get better looking in time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>Another <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html">Rails Girls Ljubljana workshop</a> also meant another lecture on how the internet works and the basics of programming. The goal was to ease in the participants, this time mostly high school girls, into the practical workshop that consisted of creating a <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/">web app for collecting ideas in Rails</a>.&nbsp;I was pretty happy with the <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html#more">first version of the lecture</a> I did for our very <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html">first workshop</a> that used a cute story about <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>'s <a href="http://octodex.github.com/">Octocat</a>, who loves sushi, but doesn't eat fish.</p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" /></a></div><br />However, there were two majors issues we discovered by using the first version of the lecture at the workshop:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://tryruby.org/">TryRuby.org</a>, an otherwise super cute website,&nbsp;didn't behave well during our workshop. With about 75 laptops on the same network, the site was painfully slow at moments, making it difficult for girls to keep up. Also, the order in which concepts are introduced in the tutorial is difficult for beginners (arrays make a surprisingly early appearance, for instance).</li><li>Beginners were a bit confused during the practical part of the workshop about switching from Terminal and local files with code. The meaning of all those directories and files in their Rails project wasn't very clear.</li></ul><div>All that meant I had to roll up my sleeves again and create version 2.0 that includes a giant dragon!<br /><!-- more --></div><br /><h2>Explaining the basics of programming in 15 minutes</h2>The solution to the first problem was to scratch TryRuby.org from the program. Not saying TryRuby.org isn't useful, but it's not ideal when you have a larger group of people trying to keep up with you. Instead, I advised girls to go through the exercises at home, and introduced some basic concepts of programming in a different way.<br /><br />I decided to show participants how to use <i>irb</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell">Interactive Ruby Shell</a>) in Terminal and how to create Ruby files in Sublime Text and running them from a Terminal (<i>ruby file.rb)</i>. In this way, I also addressed the second problem, as I gradually introduced the tools they would be using during the workshop. With different irb and .rb examples, I quickly introduced some of the most basic concepts of programming languages: different types of objects (strings, integers), methods, variables, if statements. Really basic stuff.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7T4GcLzOyrk/UTzwtRarA3I/AAAAAAAAAv4/RQujf3cOuqs/s1600/big-scary-dragon-lego.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7T4GcLzOyrk/UTzwtRarA3I/AAAAAAAAAv4/RQujf3cOuqs/s1600/big-scary-dragon-lego.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I also decided to introduce a new metaphor for computer programs:<b> a big, scary dragon</b>, which is what code looks like to beginners. It's only upon closer inspection that you realize that the dragon is built with basic Lego blocks you get to know right at the beginning of any coding course. When learning code for the first time, you can't go straight into building a big dragon, of course; it might even seem like an impossible task! So you start practicing by making small houses, cars, until you get a hang of it or find a good coach or online tutorial that shares with you the dragon construction secrets.<br /><br />I know, the explanation wasn't perfect, and maybe it wasn't all clear to those with zero experience. I hope I was at least able to show them programming can be deconstructed into smaller, readable and easy to understand blocks.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0A5Xxw8BlxI/UTzxDuPqYgI/AAAAAAAAAwA/wdt84LDOaFc/s1600/rails-mvc-sushi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0A5Xxw8BlxI/UTzxDuPqYgI/AAAAAAAAAwA/wdt84LDOaFc/s1600/rails-mvc-sushi.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />And finally, I also added a slide about the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/codeinmotion/mvc-demystified-essence-of-ruby-on-rails">MVC architecture</a>&nbsp;that basically serves the purpose of explaining why there are so many different folders and files in a Rails project. I heard some coaches referring to the slide during their explanations, so I think it did its trick.<br /><br /><h2>Web and programming intro slides (English and Slovenian)</h2>I wrote in more detail about how I used the rest of the slides to explain the internet and web apps in <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html">my previous post</a>, so today I'm just going to share the updated slides again. The original lecture used Slovenian slides, but I also made an English translation. If you do find any of the stuff useful, do feel free to borrow.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15661527" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="512"> </iframe> </div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/the-web-and-programming-an-introduction-simple-short-and-friendly" target="_blank" title="The web and programming: an introduction - Simple, short and friendly ">The web and programming: an introduction - Simple, short and friendly </a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15661515" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="512"></iframe></div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/uvod-v-internet-in-programiranje-enostavno-kratko-in-prijazno" target="_blank" title="Uvod v internet in programiranje: Enostavno, kratko in prijazno">Uvod v internet in programiranje: Enostavno, kratko in prijazno</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div></div><br />And finally, if you happen to understand Slovenian, you can also watch a recording of my lecture below. Even without speaking a word of Slovenian you'll probably appreciate the awesomeness of the video player used below, combining both video and slides.
