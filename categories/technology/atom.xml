    <updated>2013-11-10T18:16:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ialja.com/2013/11/10/europe-code-week</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At this year's <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/06/22/entering-the-digital-playing-field-as-one-european-team-da13/">Digital Assembly</a>, me and my fellow <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">Neelie Kores' Young Advisors</a> were challenged to pick a common theme to work on. One suggestion was to focus on providing every young European with opportunities to start learning coding. Out of this suggestion, <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Europe Code Week</a> was born over summer.</p>

<p><a href="http://codeweek.eu"><img class="Europe Code Week" src="/images/uploads/codeu-logo.png"></a></p>

<p>The key idea is to have one week, November 25 - 30, dedicated to promoting coding all over Europe. By doing this, we hope to put existing initiatives like <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a>, <a href="http://coderdojo.com/">CoderDojos</a> and more on the map, spread best practices and encourage more initiatives to be started. The initiative was officially announced three weeks ago by <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/25-30-november-europe-code-week">Neelie Kroes on her blog</a>.</p>

<h2>The amazing Coding Map of Europe</h2>

<p><a href="http://codeweek.eu/map"><img class="Coding Map of Europe" src="/images/uploads/code_map-20131108.jpg"></a></p>

<p>And I must say I'm completely blown away by the response! Especially by what's going on in Croatia and Ireland, both countries where we have a teacher ambassador. Coincidence? Don't think so!</p>

<p>In <a href="http://codeweek.eu/learn/croatia/">Croatia</a>, Ivana Ružić, an informatics teacher, managed to get over 800 students and teachers involved in 16 #codeEU events all over the country in a very short time. In Ireland, Young Advisor <a href="http://www.juliecullen.com">Julie Cullen</a>, rallied up the CoderDojo community and over 200 Irish organization and even managed to promote <a href="http://codeweek.eu/news/2013/11/02/europe-code-week-ireland-web-summit.html">Code Week at the Web Summit</a>, Europe's biggest tech conference!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As usually, the media isn't showing much interest despite the good news we've been getting from all over Europe. At the time of writing, we have <a href="http://codeweek.eu/news/2013/11/08/over-100-coding-opportunities-in-europe.html">over 100 initiatives</a> on the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/map/">Coding Map of Europe</a>. For some reason, a huge number of people volunteering their free time to help others learn new skills that will be essential for our future still isn't headline worthy. I'm hoping this changes as the events themselves start to unfold.</p>

<p>Yes, it's true, our little initiative isn't as big as the <a href="http://code.org/hourofcode">Hour of Code</a> on the other side of the ocean. They've got the big names, the big sponsors. Which is great! But why can't we do something similar here in Europe? Right now, Europe Code Week is just a very small group of volunteers, mostly Young Advisors. I hacked the website together over a weekend (it shows!), but we keep getting emails of support from all over the continent. I'm especially happy when we receive emails from people, who are considering starting something new because of Code Week.</p>

<h2>Europe Code Week in Slovenia</h2>

<p>One of the first emails was actually from my own country. <a href="http://www.mozilla.si">Mozilla Space</a> in Novo mesto, Slovenia, immediately embraced the initiative and they'll be hosting their first <a href="https://webmaker.org/en">Mozilla Webmaker</a> workshop during Code Week. The goal of the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2012/05/22/introducing-mozilla-webmaker/">Webmaker project</a> is to help millions of people move from just <em>using</em> the web to <em>making</em> the web. I was delighted to hear they had to expand the capacity of the workshop due to high demand.</p>

<p><iframe width="" height="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lqMzBoiRr30 " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<p>This supports my own experience with organizing <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html/">Rails Girls workshops in Slovenia</a>. There is in fact an insane amount of demand for digital skills! And while it's never been easier to learn through websites like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> and the rest, it's much easier, faster and enjoyable to learn in good company among peers.</p>

<p>At the moment, I don't have the resources to organize another Rails Girls due to everything that is happening with Europe Code Week and an intense startup job on top of it. But I've been part of <a href="https://github.com/codecatz/">CodeCatz</a>, a small study group for women who want to learn more about programming, since summer. It's a weekly commitment and so far we've learned the basics of <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">Python</a>, started sharing code with <a href="http://try.github.io/">GitHub</a>, made our first web apps with <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask</a>, explored the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">holy trinity of the web</a> (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), and are now moving onto <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/">Django</a> with the aim of building an actual project as a team.</p>

<p>Eventually, we'll do a "lessons learned" review and see how we can grow the movement from a small room hosted each Wednesday by <a href="http://www.zemanta.com">Zemanta</a> onto other chapters and forward. For Europe Code Week, we've invited a couple of high school students who are learning about entrepreneurship with the help of <a href="http://www.ustvarjalnik.org">Ustvarjalnik</a> to join us. They'll pitch their business ideas, and we'll teach them how to use technology to turn those ideas into reality. I bet it's going to be a fun evening!</p>

<p>This week I also attended my first CoderDojo as a coach. It was great helping kids build their first game. I still remember the few programming lessons I took as a kid. Learning to move the turtle across the screen in <a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/turtle.html">Logo</a>. I didn't take many of these lessons and didn't grow up to be a programmer, but it certainly helped me to understand computers better and not to be afraid of technology.</p>

<h2>Why learn coding right now?</h2>

<p>And now, more than 20 years after my Logo lessons, I'm finding myself coding again. I don't work as a developer, probably never will. But with every bit of technology I learn to understand, I get better at my own job, which usually involves a lot of writing in human readable languages.</p>

<p>By understanding technology, I can build a bridge between user requirements and the technical implementation. When I have to write texts for an app or test the user experience, I can now build my own prototype. It's not pretty or usable in production, but it works and helps me do my job better before anyone else has to write a single line of code. Not to mention I'm also getting better at automating tedious tasks and extracting data when I need it.</p>

<p>What this means is that I don't expect everyone to become a programmer. But our lives and work are increasingly connected with technology. If you're a writer, you can use your skills to make apps more human. If you're a researcher, you need to know how to extract and manage data from various sources. By understanding technology, you can help shape its future.</p>

<p>That is why we should get the whole Europe coding. Technology startups are our future. But we can't grow without more talent on the market. Not just programmers, but people who understand technology and use it to be better at whatever it is they do.</p>

<h2>Now is the time to act!</h2>

<p>So, if you can code, at any level, why don't you share what you know with somebody around you? As we like to say, two is a group already! And if you've never done any coding, today is the day to start learning. No matter where you're coming from, the important thing is to start.</p>

<p>There are two weeks left until <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Europe Code Week</a>. We still need help to fill in the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/map/">Coding Map of Europe</a> and spread the word about all the amazing initiatives and events. Will you help us?</p>

    <link href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/26/im-in-love-with-markdown/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-26T11:25:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/26/im-in-love-with-markdown</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just want to go on the record for saying that I really, really love Markdown:</p>

<blockquote><p>"… a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)." - <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, it's a simple way of writing for the web that lets you focus on the content. Because it's plain text, it's also incredibly easy to carry across multiple devices and platform (even mobile ones) and it's much more future proof than  some proprietary software format.</p>

<p>In fact, it's so simple, you'll probably say: "Wait, there's all there is to it?" when you see an example of Markdown like the one below. Yep, it's that simple. And that's precisely why it's so brilliant!</p>

<pre><code># This is the main title

## And this is a level 2 heading

Look, some text! **Bold** text and a [link](http://ialja.com)

## Let's try another section

How about a list of item?

- Cats
- Dogs
- Frogs

And a horizontal line for the big finish.

* * *
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>The example from below will look like this on the web:</p>

<h1>This is the main title</h1>

<h2>And this is a level 2 heading</h2>

<p>Look, some text! <strong>Bold</strong> text and a <a href="http://ialja.com">link</a></p>

<h2>Let's try another section</h2>

<p>How about a list of item?</p>

<ul>
<li>Cats</li>
<li>Dogs</li>
<li>Frogs</li>
</ul>


<p>And a horizontal line for the big finish.</p>

<h2>iA Writer got me hooked on Markdown</h2>

<p>In fact, it's so deceivingly simple, you might not even notice that you need Markdown at all. When I first saw screenshots of <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac/">iA Writer</a>, I thought it looked awkward and unnecessary. Why would I want to look at a boring screen with the same big font all day, no option to add colors and other fancy stuff? Because it helps me write faster and better, that's why. But you can't really see it until you give it a proper try and actually get some work done.</p>

<p>Yesterday I came across a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/23/markdown-book">recommendation</a> for an <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">e-book on Markdown</a> on <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, John Gruber's blog. Because Gruber just happens to be the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">father of Markdown</a> and because I'm spending more and more time in iA Writer, my Markdown editor of choice, I couldn't resist tapping on that buy button in my iBooks store.</p>

<p><img class="The MacSparky Markdown Field Guide on iPad" src="/images/uploads/markdown-ebook.jpg"></p>

<h2>The ultimate Markdown guide and Marked, my new best friend</h2>

<p><a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">The MacSparky Markdown Field Guide</a> is indeed a wonderful ebook that will guide you through the important aspects with easy to follow screencasts. It should work well for both beginners and those of us who want to take our basic Markdowning (not sure that's a word) skills to the next level. I certainly did learn a couple of new tricks, and iA Writer got a new best friend: <a href="http://markedapp.com">Marked</a>.</p>

<p>Marked is not an editor, but a preview app for all sorts of advanced Markdown such as reference-style links   that iA Writer doesn't support on its own. With one <a href="http://support.iawriter.com/help/kb/general-questions/how-can-i-preview-markdown">simple script</a> you can send the document you're working on in iA Writer to Marked and look at the fancy preview side by side when you're proofreading.</p>

<p><img class="iA Writer and Marked side by side" src="/images/uploads/iawriter-marked-post.png"></p>

<p>Not to mention that Marked also supports link verification, provides a handy table of contents for quickly jumping to different sections, supports custom CSS files that modify the look of the preview window, and tons of different export formats that will use your custom CSS. Totally in love.</p>

<p>What can I say about Markdown that hasn't been said before? Yes, it has made me a better writer. I am more focused on the writing, I spend less time fiddling with unnecessary design settings that are relevant for print, but not for the web. I create blog posts faster. Which is why I was so excited when I found out <a href="/2013/03/22/goodbye-blogger-hello-octopress/">a way</a> to base my personal blog entirely on Markdown files.</p>

<h2>Why you should also learn Markdown</h2>

<p>So, if you're doing any sort of writing for the web and haven't yet explored Markdown, you should fix this immediately. And even if you're doing more traditional writing, Markdown could be a great way to keep you from getting distracted. You could start with these links:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://designshack.net/articles/html/mastering-markdown-30-resources-apps-and-tutorials-to-get-you-started/">Mastering Markdown: 30 Resources, Apps and Tutorials to Get You Started</a></li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Daring Fireball: Markdown Syntax Documentation</a></li>
</ul>


<p>But if you really want an easy and step by step guide, <a href="http://macsparky.com/markdown/">The MacSparky Markdown Field Guide</a> is definitely the way to go.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The recent <a href="http://ialja.com/post/45336943328/hitler-finds-out-google-reader-is-shutting-down">Google Reader fiasco</a> reminded me of something I've been too lazy to take care of for too long: my blog, which I started back in 2006, was still being hosted on Google's Blogger. Now here's a question for you: how long before Google decides all blogging should be done on Google+? Ridiculous question? I don't know. I don't feel like taking chances with Google anymore. But what are the alternatives?</p>

<p><img src="/images/uploads/blogger-to-octopress.png"></p>

<h2>When WordPress feels like an overkill</h2>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a> was an obvious answer. I love WordPress. It's really powerful and it's what we use over at <a href="http://tehnik.mobitel.si">Mobitel Tehnik</a>. But is it really what my small blog, where I probably know most readers by name, needs?</p>

<p>Not to mention that "WordPress" isn't such a clear answer. You can decide to <a href="http://wordpress.org">self-host WordPress</a>, which is something I'm way too lazy to do. I don't want to deal with databases, with updates (I'm way too likely to click "Remind me later") and all that stuff.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://wordpress.com">free wordpress.com</a> blog wasn't a good answer either as I wanted to use a custom domain and have some customization options. After all, what's the point of WordPress if you can't have your own plugins?</p>

<p>That leaves paying someone else to do all the work of hosting and maintaining WordPress for me. While I fully support paying people for their trouble, I was again wondering if this little blog of mine is worth it. On bad years, I barely write more than 10 posts total! And I don't really need things like scheduling and countless categories and tags...</p>

<h2>Here come GitHub Pages and Octopress!</h2>

<p>And while I was pondering the big questions of life and my future blog hosting needs, I stumbled upon <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which defines itself as a "blogging framework for hackers". I don't really define myself as a hacker, but the proposition was tempting: Octopress is an easier way to set up <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, "the blog aware static site generator powering <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>". I started playing with GitHub Pages recently and immediately fell in love with how easy and fast is to host static HTML files there.</p>

<p>So, Octopress is free, can be hosted on GitHub Pages, is super fast because it's all static in the end, it's totally customizable, and even has plugins? Sounds good, let's give it a try!</p>

<p>Thanks to my recent <a href="/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html">Rails Girls adventures</a>, my MacBook Pro was already equipped with Ruby and Git, which made the Octopress really easy to <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">setup</a>. <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/">Deploying</a> the blog was also relatively easy with GitHub Pages, and before I knew it, I already had my new subdomain blog.ialja.com pointing to my Octopress blog.</p>

<h2>The challenges and joys of having a geeky blog</h2>

<p>I'm not saying this is something I recommend to everyone. I'm still finding my way around the command-line, as it hasn't really been part of my usual workflow until now. But that's precisely the point for me. <strong>I'm teaching myself something new</strong> and I don't ever remember having so much fun (and little frustrations) while setting up a blog!</p>

<p>The tricky part was moving my posts to Blogger from Octopress. Why did I want that, why not just start fresh? Because I wanted a relatively future proof backup that I can control. It's not just on GitHub for everyone to explore, it's also on my hard drive in nicely organized files. I even got the chance to clean up the mess that was my Blogger tags; I now use only 4 basic categories, everything else will be found with search.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find out that getting the content out from Blogger was pretty easy - hit Export and you get one big XML file. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/juniorz/1564581">import script for Octopress</a> was also easy to use once I got all the gems properly installed. Sure, the gems part got a bit tricky, but not impossible thanks to my new favorite website <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>And then I started playing with the import script. For that I had to pretend to speak Ruby (again, Stack Overflow plus the Ruby Documentation to the rescue). There are two main things I added to the script:
- custom permalinks for imported blog posts that mirror those on the original Blogger blog and
- information about where the blog post was originally published that I added at the end of each blog post.</p>

<p>Because I'm too lazy to go through every post to make sure it looks ok, I decided to keep the old Blogger blog alive as a reference. I don't really have any meaningful SEO to obsess about, so I decided not to worry about redirects, I'll just add a simple disclaimer about the new location on the old blog.</p>

<p>I held my breath while I committed the update with imported Blogger posts, but everything seems to be working just fine. The final piece of the puzzle was migrating Disqus comments, which couldn't be easier. Thanks to my foresight of perfectly mapping the links of old Blogger posts to new ones on Octopress, it literally took a few clicks for Disqus to take care of everything. Pure magic!</p>

<h2>A happy ending? Maybe.</h2>

<p>And so, here we are now. I am writing this blog post in Markdown in my beloved iA Writer, where all my blog drafts are made anyway. And when I'll be happy with the text, I'll fire up my Terminal, rake deploy, git commit and all that stuff, and you'll be served this page from GitHub pages. Totally geeky. And for the record, I just want to say that I love the internet and all the good folks that wrote all the wonderful open source software that made this moment possible for me.</p>

<p>If you've got any questions about the transition, let me know. Otherwise I hope you'll enjoy the new place as much as I do. I know it isn't very pretty yet. I still have to start poking around the design drawer, so I promise it will also get better looking in time.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/how-lego-dragon-helped-me-explain.html"/>
    <updated>2013-03-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/how-lego-dragon-helped-me-explain</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<p>Another <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html">Rails Girls Ljubljana workshop</a> also meant another lecture on how the internet works and the basics of programming. The goal was to ease in the participants, this time mostly high school girls, into the practical workshop that consisted of creating a <a href="http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/">web app for collecting ideas in Rails</a>.&nbsp;I was pretty happy with the <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html#more">first version of the lecture</a> I did for our very <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html">first workshop</a> that used a cute story about <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>'s <a href="http://octodex.github.com/">Octocat</a>, who loves sushi, but doesn't eat fish.</p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8DX0ZyAnn0Q/UM4u0gg6VII/AAAAAAAAAoU/fp7QnqPoDow/s1600/rails-girls-intro-web.png" /></a></div><br />However, there were two majors issues we discovered by using the first version of the lecture at the workshop:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://tryruby.org/">TryRuby.org</a>, an otherwise super cute website,&nbsp;didn't behave well during our workshop. With about 75 laptops on the same network, the site was painfully slow at moments, making it difficult for girls to keep up. Also, the order in which concepts are introduced in the tutorial is difficult for beginners (arrays make a surprisingly early appearance, for instance).</li><li>Beginners were a bit confused during the practical part of the workshop about switching from Terminal and local files with code. The meaning of all those directories and files in their Rails project wasn't very clear.</li></ul><div>All that meant I had to roll up my sleeves again and create version 2.0 that includes a giant dragon!<br /><!-- more --></div><br /><h2>Explaining the basics of programming in 15 minutes</h2>The solution to the first problem was to scratch TryRuby.org from the program. Not saying TryRuby.org isn't useful, but it's not ideal when you have a larger group of people trying to keep up with you. Instead, I advised girls to go through the exercises at home, and introduced some basic concepts of programming in a different way.<br /><br />I decided to show participants how to use <i>irb</i> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell">Interactive Ruby Shell</a>) in Terminal and how to create Ruby files in Sublime Text and running them from a Terminal (<i>ruby file.rb)</i>. In this way, I also addressed the second problem, as I gradually introduced the tools they would be using during the workshop. With different irb and .rb examples, I quickly introduced some of the most basic concepts of programming languages: different types of objects (strings, integers), methods, variables, if statements. Really basic stuff.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7T4GcLzOyrk/UTzwtRarA3I/AAAAAAAAAv4/RQujf3cOuqs/s1600/big-scary-dragon-lego.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7T4GcLzOyrk/UTzwtRarA3I/AAAAAAAAAv4/RQujf3cOuqs/s1600/big-scary-dragon-lego.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />I also decided to introduce a new metaphor for computer programs:<b> a big, scary dragon</b>, which is what code looks like to beginners. It's only upon closer inspection that you realize that the dragon is built with basic Lego blocks you get to know right at the beginning of any coding course. When learning code for the first time, you can't go straight into building a big dragon, of course; it might even seem like an impossible task! So you start practicing by making small houses, cars, until you get a hang of it or find a good coach or online tutorial that shares with you the dragon construction secrets.<br /><br />I know, the explanation wasn't perfect, and maybe it wasn't all clear to those with zero experience. I hope I was at least able to show them programming can be deconstructed into smaller, readable and easy to understand blocks.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0A5Xxw8BlxI/UTzxDuPqYgI/AAAAAAAAAwA/wdt84LDOaFc/s1600/rails-mvc-sushi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0A5Xxw8BlxI/UTzxDuPqYgI/AAAAAAAAAwA/wdt84LDOaFc/s1600/rails-mvc-sushi.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />And finally, I also added a slide about the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/codeinmotion/mvc-demystified-essence-of-ruby-on-rails">MVC architecture</a>&nbsp;that basically serves the purpose of explaining why there are so many different folders and files in a Rails project. I heard some coaches referring to the slide during their explanations, so I think it did its trick.<br /><br /><h2>Web and programming intro slides (English and Slovenian)</h2>I wrote in more detail about how I used the rest of the slides to explain the internet and web apps in <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/explaining-web-and-web-programming-with.html">my previous post</a>, so today I'm just going to share the updated slides again. The original lecture used Slovenian slides, but I also made an English translation. If you do find any of the stuff useful, do feel free to borrow.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15661527" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="512"> </iframe> </div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/the-web-and-programming-an-introduction-simple-short-and-friendly" target="_blank" title="The web and programming: an introduction - Simple, short and friendly ">The web and programming: an introduction - Simple, short and friendly </a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15661515" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="512"></iframe></div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/uvod-v-internet-in-programiranje-enostavno-kratko-in-prijazno" target="_blank" title="Uvod v internet in programiranje: Enostavno, kratko in prijazno">Uvod v internet in programiranje: Enostavno, kratko in prijazno</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div></div><br />And finally, if you happen to understand Slovenian, you can also watch a recording of my lecture below.

<p>It can be surprisingly easy to not notice things because "that's just the way it is". I have to admit I used to feel that way about the lack of women in tech. Just as a lot of women in the industry, I quickly started to think of myself as on of the guys and not even notice that I'm consistently a part of a minority at most tech events. In some ways, I was lucky that my mom was a geek even before that was a fashionable word and that I grew up without ever knowing computers were boys’ toys.&nbsp;But once you do start paying attention, it's impossible to turn the other way.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RailsGirlsLjubljana" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4OKqKxKxZV0/UTm6bGHM6UI/AAAAAAAAAvo/7GSUhnkdTfc/s1600/734397_517868904919059_991205745_n.jpg" width="580" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Self-driving cars will be on our roads soon, so why is it that seeing a large group of girls in front of a computer science faculty is still an exception reserved for Rails Girls events?&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><!-- more --><h2>Once you notice the gap, it stings your eyes</h2>I first started paying attention a few years ago. Ok, I'm one of the few women in tech. But surely things are changing because it's getting easier to get involved in the field? I mean, it's not like you've got to be super geeky to have a computer in 2013, programming languages have actually become readable to mere mortals, and you can learn how to code online. Yeah, all right, I see more girls popping up at events, but not nearly enough. Andraž Tori  recently did a great <a href="http://andraz.wpengine.com/2013/02/women-in-computer-science/" title="http://andraz.wpengine.com/2013/02/women-in-computer-science/">analysis of women in computer science at University in Ljubljana</a> and the data doesn't really show any positive trends.<br /><br />Which is all why I agreed to do lecture at MobileCamp Ljubljana almost exactly two years ago: <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2011/03/android-for-girls-new-frontier.html" title="/2011/03/android-for-girls-new-frontier.html">Android for girls: a new frontier</a>. I was quite self-conscious about speaking about about the topic. But you know what? It actually got a lot of positive attention! I realized that a lot of guys, developers, in fact don't usually think about half of their potential customers and they welcomed my practical tips on how to make apps more women (aka human) friendly! Crazy, right?<br /><br /><h2>Why is it even important to get more women in tech?</h2>After that experience it was easier for me to do a couple of more lectures on the topic of women in IT and especially startups. And while I was preparing the lectures (you can browse the slides below), I discovered more and more research pointing to the fact that this is a real issue in most parts of the world! <b>Women are increasingly more interested in technology, from the consumer side, but they are not as actively involved in the creation of technology. </b>Which of course means that we have tons of gadgets and apps on the market that were clearly made by white, straight guys living in a tech bubble. Nothing wrong by being a white, straight guy, mind you, but that's not even a majority group in the world. So how can we get all other groups to join the fun?<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15326515" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="512"> </iframe> </div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/what-about-the-other-half-of-your-customers" target="_blank" title="What about the other half of your customers?">What about the other half of your customers?</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="421" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15449092?startSlide=3" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="512"> </iframe> </div><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja/startup-women-startupday" target="_blank" title="Zakaj v startup svetu nikoli ni vrste pred ženskim straniščem?">Zakaj v startup svetu nikoli ni vrste pred ženskim straniščem?</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ialja" target="_blank">Alja Isakovic</a></strong> </div></div><br /><h2>My suspicious were confirmed by reading applications for Rails Girls </h2>One thing I found I could do was to accept the challenge of organizing <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>, a programming workshop for girls. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. The demand blew our mind. Surpassed even the wildest expectations. And by reading through each and every one of the 586 applications for our first workshop, I did get further proof that this was a real issue.<br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>Girls, women of all ages are eager to learn about how the tools we use every day are made.</strong> Telling us about how their boyfriends, fathers, other men in their lives, dismiss their interest in technology with "You wouldn't understand." or "You wouldn't find that interesting." Women of all ages saying they always felt like programming was only for guys. Women embracing the opportunity to learn a technical subject in a safe environment where guys can’t accuse them of asking stupid questions. And so on and on.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-783NUjYE_fQ/UTm3TzayW-I/AAAAAAAAAu4/EyiIe92b6dQ/s640/RailsGirlsLjubljana-racunalnik-KatarinaJazbec.jpg" width="580" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Photo by Katarina Jazbec</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I already wrote about what a <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html" title="/2012/12/when-magic-happens-at-rails-girls.html">magical event our first Rails Girls workshop was</a>. Not just because of the girls’ enthusiasm, but also because of our wonderful coaches. Guys and girls, experienced programmers, most without teaching experience. All eager to do it again.<br /><br /><h2>Rails Girls Ljubljana strikes again, this time with high school girls</h2>And we did it again. This time with the help of the <a href="http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/">Faculty of Computer in Information Science</a> here in Ljubljana. As we were discussing a joint workshop, we realized we could do a workshop just before high school students in our country decide where to continue their education. And so <b>we specifically tried to promote the workshop among high school girls.</b> This time we got 135 applications, though only 50 girls were under the age of 19 (I'm sure we’d get way more applications if we hadn't specified the event was mainly for high schoolers).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.517860094919940.1073741825.466225130083437&type=3" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r_e76USRVQg/UTm4GEmWdAI/AAAAAAAAAvE/q1aqbZm31MM/s1600/6553_517433124962637_241234575_n.jpg" width="580" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table>We accepted all high school girls who applied. And on March 2 had another great event. It was a bit different though. Some girls were more shy, one even gave up after a mere hour - we had no such case at our first workshop, where the average age was well above 30. But some of the girls were even more eager than last time. <strong>Three interesting stories stood out for me</strong>:<br /><ul><li>A group of girls was interested in seeing the server room at the faculty.<br /></li><li>Another group was discussing about making an app for rating boys at their school. That’s, by the way, how Facebook started #justsaying<br /></li><li>A group told their coach they weren’t interested in the design tutorial. Instead, they wanted their coach to show them how to make another app, so that they would be able to do it on their own at home again.<br /></li></ul>So, you still want to tell me girls find programming and technology boring? All they need is a positive experience, and their imagination starts working at full speed! I was also pleasantly surprised when a TV crew visited our event, saying they got at least three emails&nbsp;internally&nbsp;saying they should stop by. And while we didn't make it into prime time news, we had a slot in the Saturday evening news on the national TV network. If you understand Slovenian or don't mind just looking at the action, you <a href="http://tvslo.si/predvajaj/porocila-ob-22h/ava2.160117678/00:06:31/0:8:20/">can see the news here</a>.<br /><br /><h2>Lessons learned from Rails Girls</h2>To sum it all up, here are some of the lessons I have learned while getting more actively involved in promoting technology among women:<br /><ul><li><b>We need more events like Rails Girls.</b> Seeing a room full of girls coding should be no more strange than a room full of guys coding.<br /></li><li>We still need to figure out a follow up to Rails Girls. Advanced workshops, meetups, hackatons… I don't know yet. But it needs to become a regular thing, not just an occasional flash mob.<br /></li><li>Yes, you can learn to code online in many different ways. But it's still intimidating for a lot of beginners, especially women who still think technology isn't for them. The social aspect of learning and the ability to have a coach tailor the learning experience on the spot is very important for some! <br /></li><li>Related to the previous point, a relaxed and flexible environment facilitates learning. Small groups working at their own pace, coming up with new questions as they go. All girls did learn a lot at our workshops, but they didn’t necessarily all learn the same exact things.<br /></li><li>I really enjoyed working with the faculty on our second workshop. Their coaches had no problem embracing the Rails Girls organized chaos, and they also worked well with other coaches. And I think this can be a good model of academia and the private sector joining forces. It was great seeing coaches with different background sharing their knowledge and experiences with beginners. I'd like to see that happen more regularly, and not just with coding for women.</li></ul><div><br /></div><h2>Encourage women in your life to embrace technology </h2>And by the way, it is not a coincidence that I am writing this blog post on March 8, the International Women's Day. It's a day when my Facebook feed is filled with pictures of flower bouquets and kind words of appreciation. Thanks for noticing us for one day, but you know what? <strong>If we really want to help women succeed, we need to arm them with two key things: education and technology.</strong><br /><br />ICT is continuously transforming all areas of our lives, and we can't allow half of the population to fall behind, to stay on the spectator side. Girls, women, it's time to stand up, speak up, and embrace technology! Just because you have a womb, it doesn't mean you can't handle a computer. The <a href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/girls-go-geek-again/">first software programmers were women</a>, let's not forget that! And it's not about talking over the world, it's about equal opportunities and active participation in the shaping of a better future for all of us.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/girls-go-geek-again/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CozWAob3BNM/UTm5iuTrQiI/AAAAAAAAAvY/1uftGYgX2GQ/s400/eniac+girls.jpg" width="580" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eniac Girls started it ...&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Don't get me wrong, I don't want everyone becoming a programmer - I am not a programmer myself, yet I benefit immensely in everything I do by understanding how things work. There are a lot of cool things you can do with technology and soon we will have very few jobs that don't involve any digital skills. Will you be ready for that world?<br /><br />To finish on a positive note, I would like to point out that there are many wonderful initiatives around the world you can get involved in. <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a>, <a href="http://girlgeekdinners.com/">Geek Girl Dinners</a>, <a href="http://www.ladygeek.com/" title="http://www.ladygeek.com">Lady Geek</a>, <a href="http://sheplusplus.stanford.edu/" title="http://sheplusplus.stanford.edu">She++</a>, just to mention a few. And in Europe we have a big partnership, <a href="http://women2020.org/" title="http://women2020.org">Women2020</a>, launching today at <a href="http://www.digitaleurope.org/" title="http://www.digitaleurope.org/">DIGITALEUROPE</a>, <i>"whose mission is to promote women’s contribution to achieving the Europe 2020 vision of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."</i> There will be many big scale events and discussions going on throughout the year, culminating in the release of Women2020 Action Plan in December.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://women2020.org/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="56" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1aET6FgYwEc/UTm4uj_gMiI/AAAAAAAAAvM/R_kT5XvMVko/s400/cropped-women202011.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Having just met many wonderful and enthusiastic women both from the European Comission and various big and small enterprises in <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/03/how-i-found-great-chocolate-in-brussels.html">Brussels</a>, I think this could be a big and important thing. But in the end, it will come to each and every one of us, women and men, to play our part and provide support for women entering the field. I certainly hope I will have a lot more to write about the subject this year. And not just about the issue, but mostly about the results of our efforts.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><italic>Originally published at <a href='http://ialja.blogspot.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html'>http://ialja.blogspot.com/2013/03/lessons-learned-from-rails-girls-and.html</a></italic><br/><br/></div>
